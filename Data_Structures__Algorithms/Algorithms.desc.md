## Description

* Elevator Pitch: A set of steps to solve a certain problem
* Generally very reusable between seemingly unrelated problem types
* Functions and procedures you have written are probably algorithms already defined in history. You just might not know the names
* A thing Computer Scientists love. `P=NP`??? `P!=NP`???

## Types

* Exhaustive / Brute Force
* Divide and Conquer
* Search
* Randomized
* Reduction of Complexity
* Etc.
