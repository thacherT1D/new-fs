"Big O" notation is a way of describing how long an algorithm will take to run **relative to its input**.

Vocab you should know:

- Time complexity
- Aymptotic Complexity 
    - The term asymptotic means approaching a value or curve arbitrarily closely (i.e., as some sort of limit is taken) - http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Asymptotic.html
