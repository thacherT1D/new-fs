Now that we are beginning to learn how to program you may be wondering: how do we know if our code runs efficiently? "Big O" notation is a way of describing how long an algorithm will take to run **relative to its input**.

## About Big O Notation

We will be primarily using our [Computer Science Curriculum](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum) repository when learning about it. For this section, go to the [Big O](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-1/02-big-o-notation.md) file in Unit 1.
