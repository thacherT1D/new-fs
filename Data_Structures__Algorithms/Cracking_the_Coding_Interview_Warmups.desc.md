## "Cracking of dawn" morning warmups

Get it?  "Cracking the Coding Interview" + "Crack of dawn"?  Sigh...

In the second half of class, you can schedule 9am-10am as Cracking the Coding Interview problems.

Keep all students in class.  Have them all work on their own problems separately, but physically in the same place.

## Intro workshop

Explain the workshop concept.  Talk about process over product - don't cheat and look at answers.  Write everything in files that are run from the command line.  Deal with filenames / organization.  Push solutions to github for streaks.

## Review workshops

You can hold review workshops for certain topics and use certain questions as entry tickets.
