While we are used to using Arrays and Objects in JavaScript, there are many other data structures out there. You will be asked to be able to describe these data structures and implement some of them.

We will be primarily using our [Computer Science Curriculum](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum) repository while learning about these data structures. Use the following links to head to the appropriate sections:

* [Intro to Data Structures](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-2/01-intro-to-data-structures.md)

* [Linked Lists Intro](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-3/01-linked-lists-intro.md)

* [Stacks & Queues](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-3/02-stacks-and-queues.md)
