### 1) A Non-Code-Related Example with Customer-Support
For this exercise, I would have students write on a mini-whiteboard and expect something similar to the conde snippet below:

```javascript
var customerSpecialist = {
  id: 01,
  email: 'cho.kim@galvanize.com,
  library: function(question) {
    // ...
  }
};
```

### 2) A Code-Related Example with JavaScript Objects
For this exercise, have students create a list of properties and methods that are accessed through the prototype chain. After enough time, select five students and ask each to name a property or method on their list.

### 3) Three Benefits of Inheritance
For this exercise, have students pair and develop their own real-world example of prototypes. After enough time, select three pairs to share their example with the class.

### 4) Implementing with an Object Literal (`{}`)
For this exercise, select three to share their in-memory diagram on a white-board that's larage enough for the entire class to view. After each diagram, prompt the students if their diagram is correct and why. Add modificaitons to their diagram if necssary and explain the rationale.

### 5) Implementing with Object's Create Method
For this exercise, do the same as thing described for the exercise in 4 of 6.

### 6) Implementing with a Constructor
For this exercise, do the same as thing described for the exercise in 4 of 6.

### Lab
The repo is [prototype-zoo](https://github.com/gSchool/prototype-zoo)

- Have students clone this repo.
- The first test will be passing. Have a student explain/analyze what's happening with the passing test.
- Work through the first test or two as a class.
- Let students work on the rest of the repo
- Comeback and review each otherâ€™s solutions in groups (where students show their answers on the board)
