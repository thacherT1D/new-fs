After the exercise for reflection, ask the students, "Why do you think I asked you to act it out?". The answer is that every student in the course will at some point struggle with these mindsets and this process. It always breaks down at some point. By role playing and thinking ahead, they're making it easier down the road to identify breakdowns and to provide support.
