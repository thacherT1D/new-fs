1. Explain the 3 stage learning process
1. Identify your personal strengths and weaknesses in the 3 stage learning process

## Why?
Learning is essential to being a programmer. It's a huge field with new technologies and methodologies being discovered every day. Becoming a better learner will prepare you for a long and successful career. Attending a Galvanize Immersive program should transformative transform your life, and . In addition to programming skills and knowledge, we want to help grow your habits and mindsets.

At an average college or code school, you'd learn a lot, but you'd probably fall back into the same habits and mindsets you had before you started. Yes, you'd be better off for having gone back to school, but you wouldn't really have been transformed.

With our strong instructional team, teaching techniques, curriculum, and environment, you can learn two to three times as much at Galvanize. But because we operate on habits and mindsets, with the intention of helping you become a better learner, you can continue to grow at an accelerated rate even after the Galvanize program is over. Maybe not as much as when you're in school, but certainly at much faster rate than when you started.

This difference in learning speed before and after the program is what it means to be transformed and to become a new person.

In order to help you develop these new habits and mindsets, we will talk about how you can utilize the 3 Stage Learn to Learn process.

## 3 Stage Learning Process
Objective 1: Discuss the 3 stage learning process

### 1. Set the Stage
#### Clear the Stage
In order to engage in deep work, we have to eliminate distractions. Although there is some debate among neuroscientists, our working memory has a limited number of slots-- [4 or fewer](http://news.mit.edu/2011/miller-memory-0623). Therefore, you have to clear out those slots to make room for new information. Here's how you can clear the stage: 
* Have an 'I will think about this later' list where you record ideas or tasks that you need to be address, but not while you're working
* Close tabs that aren’t directly related to your work
* [Disable notifications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbhQQ298-dQ) on your laptop
* Turn off, or silence your phone
* Consider a time blocking method like [The Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)


#### Clarify the _what_ and the _why_

Know exactly what piece of knowledge or skill you are trying to master (use learning objectives to help you!)
Ask and answer for yourself:  “Why is it important for me to learn this fact or skill?”


#### Prioritize process over product
Focused practice is the key
Your goal is to move information from your working memory to your long term memory

#### Check for Understanding:
Write in your own words the first stage of the learning process.

### 2. Play

### 3. Reflect


## Exercise
