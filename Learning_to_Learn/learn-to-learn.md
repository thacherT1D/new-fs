## Why?
Learning is essential to being a programmer. It's a huge field with new technologies and methodologies being discovered every day. Becoming a better learner will prepare you for a long and successful career, and attending a Galvanize Immersive program should transform your life by helping you learn the habits and mindsets of a successful developer.

At an average college or code school, you'd learn a lot, but you'd probably fall back into the same habits and mindsets you had before you started. Yes, you'd be better off for having gone back to school, but you wouldn't really have been transformed.

With our strong instructional team, teaching techniques, curriculum, and environment, you can learn two to three times as much at Galvanize. But because we operate on habits and mindsets, with the intention of helping you become a better learner, you can continue to grow at an accelerated rate even after the Galvanize program is over. Maybe not as much as when you're in school, but certainly at much faster rate than when you started.

This difference in learning speed before and after the program is what it means to be transformed and to become a new person.

In order to help you develop these new habits and mindsets, we will show you how to utilize the 3 Stage Learn to Learn process.

## 3 Stage Learning Process
*Objective 1: Explain the 3 stage learning process*

### 1. Set the Stage
#### Clear the Stage
In order to engage in deep work, we have to eliminate distractions. We have very limited space in our working memory, just like the RAM in a computer. Although there is some debate among neuroscientists, it seems our working memory has [4 or fewer](http://news.mit.edu/2011/miller-memory-0623) slots. That means you have to get rid of everything in your working memory that's not relevant to the task at hand. Therefore, if you hope to learn as much as possible and to think as critically as possible, you need to get those things out of your head. Here's how you can clear the stage:
* Have an 'I will think about this later' list where you record ideas or tasks that you need to be address, but not while you're working
* Close all browser tabs that aren’t directly related to your work
* [Disable notifications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbhQQ298-dQ) on your laptop
* Turn off, or silence your phone
* Consider a time blocking method like [The Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/)

#### Check Your Understanding:
Take a moment to practice turning on and off your notifications.

#### Clarify the _what_ and the _why_
The second part of setting the stage is clarifying that _what_ and the _why_.The _what_ is your objective, your goal, or whatever you're trying to achieve when you're setting out to learn. In our lessons, your instructors will explicitly say what the objectives are. But when you're off learning on your own, come up with your own objectives to help you clarify and distill what you hope to achieve at the end of your session. Here are some tips to clarify the _what_:

* Use [SMART Goals](http://charlesduhigg.com/infographic-tackle-your-to-do-list/) to build your to do list
* [Build a Better To Do List](http://charlesduhigg.com/video-build-a-better-to-do-list/) with advice from Charles Duhigg

#### Check Your Understanding:
Rewrite this statement of purpose into 3-4 objectives: By the end of my practice session, I want to learn more about the command line.  


The _why_ is the meaning or motivation behind the learning. Being human is to be driven by meaning and narrative. If you can frame something you're about to do in terms that motivate you, your brain will be better primed to retain the information that's presented. No matter the topic, have a clear understanding of _why_ the topic is important, how it'll help, or how it relates to the bigger picture. Your instructors have a responsibility to clarify the why for you as well. So if you're ever unsure about why they're teaching you something, just ask.

* [13 Tricks to Motivate Yourself](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/thirteen-tricks-to-motivate-yourself.html)

#### Prioritize process over product
The last part of setting the stage is about prioritizing process over product. In other words, defining success as simply spending time doing focused and deliberate practice. This program is going to be very difficult at times. You may not fully understand some of the concepts on the first try. And you may not reach your end goal in the period of time that you set out to do your work. This is perfectly fine so long as you're challenging yourself to get better while in the [zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development).

![](https://i.imgur.com/st9ILOw.png)

While in the zone of proximal development, doing focused and deliberate practice while learning and doing will produce far more quality results in the long run. If you flip the prioritization—prioritizing product over process—you're much more likely to take shortcuts, to cheat, or to do something that benefits you in the short term but harms you in the long run. Remember, top performers do what's hard, not what they're good at.

#### Exercise:
Imagine that a friend came to Galvanize and asked you, "Hey everyone is talking about setting the stage. What does that mean? Why is that important? How do you do that?" Take a few moments to think about what you'd say to your friend. When you've decided what to say, write it down.

#### 2. Play
The second step to becoming a better learner is to play. This word is chosen very carefully as children learn at much faster rate than adults and neurological research suggests that play has a big part of it. When you think about it, it makes sense too. Children just have different attitudes when it comes to what they're trying learn and why they're doing it.

Like setting the stage, this step of the process consists of three sub-steps as well.

1. Wrestle with it
1. Take risks
1. Have fun!

#### Wrestle with it

The first part of play is to take any new information you receive and wrestle with it. In other words, think about it from different perspectives. Never be satisfied with exposing yourself to new information only once. Ask yourself questions about it, dive in, try to learn as much as you can about it.

Pick up an object that's close by, preferably something light and not too expensive. Go ahead, we'll wait.

If you look at this object just once from and from one angle, then you'll have a very two-dimensional perspective of it. It would be hard to claim that you fully understand it. But if you turn it around and look at it from different angles, smell it, taste it, rub your fingers across it, you gain familiarity and build fluency with it.

This is the goal with everything you'll learn here at Galvanize. To gain familiarity, build fluency, and eventually become intuitive with programming. Just exposing yourself to something once will never be enough. So read about it, write notes about it, write code about it, write blogs about it, talk about it, and listen about it. Do everything you can to perceive new information from as many different angles as possible so it's massaged into your long term memory.

#### Take risks

While you're playing, take risks. Be willing to make mistakes. Be willing to do something you don't know how to do yet with the understanding that it may not work out like you intend.

You've probably heard a bunch of common sayings about this already.

- "Fortune favors the bold."
- "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."
- "If you never swing the bat, you'll never hit a home run."

When it comes to learning through play, it's the effort, and not the intelligence, that makes the biggest difference. This aligns with the research done around fixed mindset versus growth mindset.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jO19KKD.png)

Training your mind with a growth mindset can be very difficult. But the reward for your persistence is being able to drink more and more from the firehose every day. Here are some things you can say to yourself that'll help train your mind to be more growth oriented.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HiEOCHw.jpg)

#### Have fun!

And the last, but equally important part of play is to have fun. If you find your jaw clenched, your shoulders tight, or your breath panicked while you're wrestling and taking risks, you're probably not having much fun. And if you're not having fun, then you're really not playing.

Having fun is not about feeling good either. When the outer cortex of your brain shuts down, we enter into fight, flight, or freeze mode. This often happens when we're afraid to show vulnerability or mistakes. When our outer cortex is shut down, the part that makes us the most human and allows us to think critically is down and we're not in an optimal state for receiving information.

When you find yourself not having fun, take a deep breath, step outside, go for a walk, do whatever you need to do to regain focus on the why. Remember, programming is just about the coolest thing you can do in this world! If that's not how you feel when you're in this program, it's time for a break.

### Exercise:
Imagine that same friend from earlier asks you, "Hey, what's this play business all about? Why is that important? How do you do that?" Take a few moments to think about what you'd say to your friend, and then write it down.

### 3. Reflect

The third and final major step to becoming a better learner is to reflect.

So you've set the stage by clearing out all the distractions, clarifying the what and the why, and prioritizing process over product. And you've spent a good long while in play mode by wrestling with new information, taking risks, and having fun. Whenever the learning period is done, it's time to reflect on what happened.

Like setting the stage and play, this step of the process consists of three sub-steps.

1. Self assess
1. Ask new questions
1. Repeat

#### Self assess

The first part of reflection is to self assess by asking yourself the following.

- What were my objectives?
- How far did I get?
- How much is left?
- How was the process?
- Did I set the stage well?
- Did I play well?
- What can I do better next time?

These are some of the most high value questions you can ask yourself. If you can do that for yourself at the end of each day, you'll multiply your ability to learn. This is one of the secrets as to why students who come through Galvanize leave transformed. They learn how to think about their own thought process and provide themselves feedback.

#### Ask new questions

The second part of reflection is to ask yourself new questions about the information you just learned. This is a powerful learning technique that helps you solidify what you know, what you still don't know, and what's most important to learn next. Forming new questions also primes you to start the cycle again by providing the motivation to keep learning. Nothing is better than a really juicy question that you're just dying to solve.

Additionally, by writing down these questions, you can go back and review them at some point down the road. Even if you don't answer them, you'll realize how far you've come based on the questions you were asking yourself earlier in your career. It's a great way to reflect on how much you've grown and the process you've gone through.

#### Repeat

The third and final step of reflection is to repeat this whole cycle. As mentioned earlier, learning never stops for programmers as there's always something new to master. The best part about mastering this learning process is that the more you practice it, the faster and easier you'll retain new information.

#### Exercise:
Picture someone who's struggling with a part of this process, maybe with clearing the stage or taking risks or self assessment. Imagine what it would look like and sound like to watch and hear someone struggling. Take a moment visualize this and then write down your thoughts.
