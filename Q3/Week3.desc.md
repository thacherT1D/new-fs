There are 3 separate workshops, and each is run 4 times during the week.  They won't be _exactly_ the same, but they are intended to cover the same material every time (just maybe from a slightly different angle).

You can choose to come to whatever workshop you want, or none at all (if you think you can meet the standard with the tools provided).  For example you could:

- Attend every workshop, every time
- Attend no workshops
- Attend one workshop a few times

By Friday you should be able to complete the assessment.
