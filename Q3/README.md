# Q3 - Data Structures, Algorithms and Object-Oriented Programming

By the end of this quarter you should be able to solve problems well-enough to pass Jr Developer whiteboard interviews and algorithm-based code challenges.

There are two main threads in this quarter:

- [Learning a technique for solving problems](https://github.com/gSchool/problem-solving-curriculum)
- [Learning data structures and algorithms](https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum)

In this quarter you and your classmates will likely diverge significantly in the pace with which you move through data structures and algorithms, and so we introduce two new learning structures this quarter:

1. A group-based drill called "Solve It!", in which you learn how to solve problems at a whiteboard
1. More independent learning time in which you may not be working on the exact same exercises as your neighbor

Like all things, you learn to solve technical problems by _actually solving_ technical problems a lot.  So much of effective problem solving involves staying calm and falling back on your training when the going gets tough.  In order to get good at that, _the going must get tough_.  That means that there _should_ be times this quarter where you spend **up to a few hours wrestling with problems**.

In your career, the problems will keep getting harder, and the number of people who will have the solutions will decrease.  In this quarter you will get exposed to an authentic glimpse of what your day-to-day will look like as a software developer, and we provide the following scaffolding to make sure you learn as efficiently as possible:

- Well-honed sequencing.  There's a lot to cover.  We've tweaked the sequencing of exercises based on experience with hundreds of students
- Automated Tests.  At any point in the day you'll know if your code meets the specs or not, right away.

To give you a sense of the ratio of Direct Instruction vs Group Work vs Independent Learning Time (ILT), here's what a week _might_ look like:

You'll notice that there's a lot of Independent Learning Time in there.  In order to make the best use of that time, you should be [Journaling](../Journaling.md).

<!-- END SCHEDULE -->

A huge part of this quarter will be spent just writing code and more code and moar code.

The overall path looks like this:

1. Programming fundamentals review
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 1
  - LinkedLists
  - Stacks and Queues
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 1
  - Basic state and behavior
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 2
  - Higher order functions
  - Recursion
  - Binary Trees
  - Trees
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 2
  - More complicated state / behavior
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 3
  - Binary search
  - Sorting algorithms
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 4
  - Graphs
  - Tries
  - Hash Tables

## How to Submit Your Code

In order for us to provide more timely feedback, please paste your solutions into the "Exercises" page directly.

## 3 Parts to the exercises

There are 3 parts to the path:

**★ Required Activities**

Required activities are indicated by a ★.  These are the activities that everyone should do.  

**Further Practice**

At times we provide alternate exercises for further practice if you want other opportunities to develop automaticity and fluency.

**Stretch**

These are generally pretty hard.  Only do them if you pretty much crushed the other stuff, and feel like you can still cover the material coming up in time.

## 🕗 Timing

Where applicable you'll see a 🕗 to indicate that there's a expectation of time involved.  This happens mostly in the earlier parts of the path, where you are building fundamental skills that you will need to build on in future exercises.

If you didn't finish it within that timeframe on your first try, **burn it down** and do it again.  If there's a time icon, it means that this is something you should be fluent in.  Solving them should be **automatic**.
