# Q3 - Group New Technology Project

The goal of this project is to put what you've learned to use to:

* [Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor](#proposal)
* [Follow an agile development workflow](#agile)
* [Create and deploy a full-stack web app](#create-deploy)
* [Make a video highlighting the functionality of your app](#video)
* [Complete a write-up of the project](#write-up)
* [Add all three of these to an online portfolio](#portfolio)
* [Present your work to the class](#present)

## Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

For this project, you will self-organize into groups of 2-6. Together, you will need to come up with a product idea, and write it as a proposal that includes:

* A project description
    * Who uses it?
    * What outputs do they need?
    * What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
* A list of technologies that you plan to use
* A well-defined and written-out feature list

There are some constraints around what technologies MUST be present in your app. Check out [Create and deploy a web app](#create-deploy) below.

## Follow Agile Workflow 

* The methodologies, tools, and roles you use are up to your team.

### Example Ideas

* Any of the ideas from previous projects
* Something that uses a geofencing API
* Something that uses a physical device like a temperature sensor or a motor
* A data analytics platform
* Sky's the limit

## Create and deploy a complete fullstack app

Your app should:

* Have a working front-end and back-end
* Use a single-page app framework for the front-end
* Persist data
* Have some authentication
* Use a third-party API
* Use *some significant technology that was not covered in the program*. Examples include:
    * Using Ember, Angular 2, React/Flux etc. on the front-end instead of Angular 1.4
    * Making a native mobile app using a wrapper like ionic framework/React Native/PhoneGap/Cordova etc.
    * Making a desktop app with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)/[React Native](https://github.com/ptmt/react-native-desktop) etc.
    * Integrating a physical device/sensor/internet of things
    * Using Rails, Spring, Java, or some other backend framework for building APIs
* All of the quality standards from earlier projects are the same as far as clean code, commit messages, READMEs, etc.

<a id="video"></a>

## Make a video highlighting the functionality of your app

* Make a 3-6 minute video explaining your project and demonstrating its features

<a id="write-up"></a>

## Complete a write-up of the project

* Describe what the project is, the technologies you used, and some information about the workflow you followed.
* 1-2 tight paragraphs

<a id="portfolio"></a>

## Add all three of these to an online portfolio

* Create a portfolio on the [student portal](http://students.galvanize.com)
* Link to your final deployed site, your video, your respositories, and your write-up
* This will be added to your web development portfolio

<a id="present"></a>

## Present your work to the class

* Be prepared to spend ~10 minutes presenting your work to the class.

This is a realistic approximation of what developing real products on a software team is like. You will have approximately 20-25 hours of class time to work on this. **It will not be enough time to do a good job on this project**. Plan on spending extra time outside of class, and coordinate this time with your team. This is another Big Deal Week, and you should put maximum effort into making it successful. You can and should use your teammates, classmates on other teams, and your instructors as learning resources, but this should be your own work.
