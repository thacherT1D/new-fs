We've spent a lot of time teaching you core concepts and practicing with warmups and exercises. Now is the time to apply that knowledge!

You will be split up into groups of 3-4 people. Each group will be completing the front end of an eCommerce site. To complete the project in full, you will need to use your knowledge of:

* HTML5 & CSS3
* Semantic HTML
* DOM Manipulation & Events
* Core JavaScript
* Agile Development
* Deployment

## Groups

You will be assigned groups! When you leave Galvanize you will most likely be working with a team of developers. Collaborating well with your team is not a nice-to-have, **it's required by the industry**.
