# Project Requirements

### The goal of this project is to put what you've learned to use and also to stretch you a little:

* [Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor](#proposal)
* [Follow an agile development workflow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NpKJ2XxkAimuaihdoR8278YrpEyZpGz7qdHt9depVx0/edit#slide=id.gc6fa3c898_0_0)
* [Create and deploy a complete CRUD app](#create-deploy)
* [Present your work to the class](#present)

### Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

For this project, you will be assigned into groups of four or five. Together, you will need to come up with a product idea, and write it as a proposal that includes:

* A project description
    * Who uses it?
    * What outputs do they need?
    * What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
* A list of technologies that you plan to use
* An MVP with listed user stories
* A list of "Nice to have" features

There are some constraints around what technologies MUST be present in your app. Check out [Create and deploy a web app](#create-deploy) below.
