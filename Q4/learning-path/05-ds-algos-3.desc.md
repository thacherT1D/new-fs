# Data Structures and Algorithms 3

## Standards

- Analyze an algorithm and identify the Big O
- Determine the correct algorithm and data structure for interview-style problems
- Implement common algorithms and describe more complex algorithms

## Objectives

By the end of these exercises you should be able to both talk about sorting and searching algorithms accurately, and also be able to implement at least one sorting algorithm from memory.  For Binary search, you should end up knowing the concept well enough that you should be able to _figure out_ the implementation on-demand.

## Rationale

Most languages have built-in sort and search methods.  So why learn these?  Sorting and searching algorithms are a fantastic proving ground for _whether you can write basic programs_.  The algorithm _design_ is insane and awesome and very few humans are at the level where they can conceive of such amazing and creative algorithms.  But the _implementation_ of sorting and searching algorithms is really just review on loops, conditionals, recursion and array manipulation.

Working through these exercises helps you build **automaticity** - you need to be **fluent** with your tools, and being able to take technical descriptions and turn them into software using loops, conditionals, recursion etc... is at the heart of your work as a programmer.
