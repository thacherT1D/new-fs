# Data Structures and Algorithms 2

## Standards

- Determine the correct algorithm and data structure for interview-style problems
- Implement common algorithms and describe more complex algorithms
- Implement, evaluate, and use some common data structures
- Identify and diagram common data structures

## Objectives

By the end of these exercises you should be familiar enough with recursion to both recognize some suitable places for it, and also be able to solve problems recursively at the whiteboard.

## Rationale

Trees are everywhere!  Your file system, the DOM, categories in HTML pages, org charts.  And getting through trees, especially using depth-first-search, is fun and easy with Recursion.

To understand recursion you need to have a working mental representation of how computers / function calls work (in other words, understanding the call stack).  This is a fundamental aspect of programming, and one that interviewers often look for.  It's not uncommon, even for junior developer interviews, to get questions that require recursion.

## Exercises

Do all of the exercises marked with a â˜….

If you can't meet the time requirements, consider doing the exercises in the sections marked "Further Practice".

If you have met the Standard, and want an extra challenge, consider doing the exercise marked "Stretch".

### Prep for the recursion exercises

Many of the examples from here on out assume you know:

1. Concepts such as mapping, filtering, reducing
1. How to write your own functions that take functions as arguments

So in order to make sure you know those things, complete this exercise:

- â˜… https://github.com/gSchool/lodash

ðŸ•—You should be able to solve the hardest of these problems in under 20 minutes.

## Recursion

- Read https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-1/04-recursion.md
- Do â˜… https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Exercises/test/recursive-iteration.test.js

ðŸ•—You should be able to make these tests pass in under an hour.

## Binary Trees

- Read https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-2/06-trees.md#trees-1
- â˜… Do https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Exercises/test/binary_tree.test.js

## Other trees

- Read all of https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-2/06-trees.md
