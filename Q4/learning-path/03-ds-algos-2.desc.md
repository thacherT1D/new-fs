# Data Structures and Algorithms 2

## Prep for the recursion exercises

Many of the examples from here on out assume you know:

1. Concepts such as mapping, filtering, reducing
1. How to write your own functions that take functions as arguments

So in order to make sure you know those things, complete this exercise:

## Recursion

- Read https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-1/04-recursion.md
- Do https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Exercises/test/recursive-iteration.test.js
- Burn it down and do it from scratch again

If you can complete those in under 2 hours, move on.  If not, do further practice.

## Further Practice

### Stretch for recursion

- Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdF1QDTRkck
- Write a function that returns all permutations of a string.  So "abc" would return `["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cab", "cba"]`

## Binary Trees

- Read https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-2/06-trees.md#trees-1
- Do https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Exercises/test/binary_tree.test.js

## Other trees

- Read all of https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-2/06-trees.md
- Do https://github.com/gSchool/javascript-challenges/tree/master/56_trees_and_recursion

### Stretch for Trees

Figure out if a text-based maze is solvable.  Could easily take a full day or two :)
