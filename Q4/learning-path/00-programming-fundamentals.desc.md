# Programming Fundamentals Review

## Standards

- Create and access complex nested data structures
- Control the flow of a program using conditionals and loops
- Encapsulate reusable code in functions

## Objectives

By the end of these exercises you should be able to execute the standards above with **fluency**.

## Rationale

When you dig into more complicated algorithms and data structures you want to be able to let your brain focus on the task at hand, not basic arrays / objects / loops / indices etc...

So while we've covered these standards before, the objective for this is **automaticity** and **fluency**.

## Exercises

Do all of the exercises marked with a â˜….

If you can't meet the time requirements, consider doing the exercises in the sections marked "Further Practice".

If you have met the Standard, and want an extra challenge, consider doing the exercise marked "Stretch".

NOTE: there' a time associated with the exercises below.  Create each solution on a branch, and then burn-and-build in order to get your time faster.  Repetition is the key to **fluency**

### Get warmed up

Complete these two:

- â˜… https://github.com/gSchool/round-robin-js

### Work with objects and arrays

Complete this exercise:

- â˜… https://github.com/gSchool/crm-data-challenge-with-json

ðŸ•—You should be able to solve all challenges in under 2 hours.

  <p><strong>Further Practice</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>https://github.com/gSchool/word-cloud-js</li>
    <li>https://github.com/gSchool/amusement-parks-objects-arrays-js</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your goal here is fluency - these exercises should seem _easy_ and _quick_.</p>

  <p>Burn them down and do it again until you feel fluent.</p>

### Do some more complicated loops

Complete this exercise:

- â˜… https://github.com/gSchool/csv-to-markdown-js

ðŸ•—You should be able to solve the main challenge in under 2 hours.

  </ul>

  <p>Your goal here is fluency - these exercises should seem _easy_ and _quick_.</p>

  <p>Burn them down and do it again until you feel fluent.</p>
