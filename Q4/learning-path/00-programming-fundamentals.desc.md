# Programming Fundamentals Review

Before digging into more complex problems, make sure you have a handle on basic `for` loops and can work to make simple tests pass.

## Get warmed up

Complete these two:

- https://github.com/gSchool/grading-js
- https://github.com/gSchool/round-robin-js

## Work with objects and arrays

Complete this exercise:

https://github.com/gSchool/crm-data-challenge-with-json

If you could do that in under 2 hours start to finish, skip ahead.  Otherwise, do these two:

- https://github.com/gSchool/word-cloud-js
- https://github.com/gSchool/amusement-parks-objects-arrays-js

Your goal here is fluency - these exercises should seem _easy_.  If not, you should:

- Burn them down and do it again, timing yourself and trying to improve your time

## Do some more complicated loops

Complete this exercise:

- https://github.com/gSchool/csv-to-markdown-js

If you can do that in under 3 hours, skip ahead.  Otherwise do at least these two:

- https://github.com/gSchool/javascript-challenges/tree/master/11_matrices
- https://github.com/gSchool/javascript-challenges/tree/master/50_multiplication_tables

Your goal here is fluency - these should seem _easy_.  If not, burn'em down and redo from scratch.

## A note on timing

Senior developers can do these exercises in minutes.  You should strive for at least sub-one-hour times.

Deleting and starting over again is a **great** way to get faster at these.
