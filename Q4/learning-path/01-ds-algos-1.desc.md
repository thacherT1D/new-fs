# Data Structures and Algorithms 1

## Standards

- Determine the correct algorithm and data structure for interview-style problems
- Implement common algorithms and describe more complex algorithms
- Identify and diagram common data structures
- Implement, evaluate, and use some common data structures

## Objectives

By the end of these exercises you should be able to pass a basic whiteboard interview question that involves Linked Lists.

## Rationale

In order to choose which data structure might be the best to use either in an interview setting or on the job, you must be familiar with at least Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.  There's enough complexity there that _talking_ about them is not enough - you should _do_ them a few times.

Interviewers tend to like Linked List questions because methods (like inserting and deleting) can easily fit on a whiteboard and can also test your ability to iterate with while loops, talk about Big O and assess your comfort level with how things work in memory.

## Exercises

Do all of the exercises marked with a â˜….

If you can't meet the time requirements, consider doing the exercises in the sections marked "Further Practice".

If you have met the Standard, and want an extra challenge, consider doing the exercise marked "Stretch".

## Linked Lists

- Read https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Unit-2/02-linked-lists-intro.md
- â˜… Do https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/tree/master/Exercises/test/linked-list

ðŸ•—You should be able to solve the main challenge start to finish in under 2 hours.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p><strong>Further Practice</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Exercises/test/linked-list.test.js</li>
    <li>https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Exercises/test/doubly_linked_list.test.js</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Your goal here is to know what's happening - for the code you write to not be mysterious.</p>

  <p>At any point you should be able to draw a diagram of the state of the Linked List</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p><strong>Further Practice</strong></p>

  <p>Revisit the Round Robin exercise and re-implement with a Linked List</p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <p><strong>Stretch</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>https://github.com/gSchool/computer-science-curriculum/blob/master/Exercises/test/lru-cache.test.js</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Implement a least-recently-used cache</p>

  <p>NOTE: this was a _real interview question_ for a remote phone screen with Google.</p>
