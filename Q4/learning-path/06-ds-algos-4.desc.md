# Data Structures and Algorithms 4

## Standards

- Analyze an algorithm and identify the Big O
- Determine the correct algorithm and data structure for interview-style problems
- Implement common algorithms and describe more complex algorithms
- Implement, evaluate, and use some common data structures
- Identify and diagram common data structures

## Objectives

By the end of these exercises you should be able to describe and diagram graphs, tries and hash tables.

## Rationale

As companies and products and applications grow, it's very common for the scale to increase.  And as scale increases, your code needs to be able to handle the new high scale, and become **performant**.  Hash tables, tries and graphs are all areas where brute-force solutions exist, but can be incredibly slow, even for relatively small inputs.

If the Standards and Objectives are around diagramming, why are there test suites?  Two reasons:

1) By _actually writing_ graphs, tries and hash tables, you will gain a much deeper understanding of, and appreciation for them.  You'll have a more complete mental representation of them, and will be able to speak and diagram them more fluently.
2) This is excellent practice for all of the other techniques you've learned up until this point
