# Object Oriented Programming 2

## Standards

- Uses `this` to manipulate the current context
- Uses Properties to store State on an Instance
- Creates “Classes” and Instances with JS
- Define and invoke functions as methods on objects

(Related)

- Define and explain the significance of the major principles of Object Oriented Programming
  - in this case namely "state" and "behavior", "classes" and "instances"

## Objectives

By the end of these exercises you should be able to solve slightly more difficult problems involving state/behavior.

## Rationale

Objects can be deceptively simple.  Because of encapsulation, you might have very simple method calls like `get(something)` or `put(something, someOtherThing)` but under the hood there are complex internal data structures and algorithms.  Senior developers can look at a problem and see both the _public_ facing methods and also _imagine_ the inner workings.  These exercises are designed for you to develop those skills.

## Exercises

Do all of the exercises marked with a ★.

If you can't meet the time requirements, consider doing the exercises in the sections marked "Further Practice".

If you have met the Standard, and want an extra challenge, consider doing the exercise marked "Stretch".
