# Q4 Learning Structures

In Q1 the main educational modality was direct instruction.  Everyone was expected to roughly be in the same spot at the same time.  

Through Q2 and Q3 the program is designed to reduce the amount of direct instruction, and increase the amount of time spent on purposeful practice and individual work.

In Q4 we move to a more blended learning model, where we have a few core structures, but everyone is expected to move at their own pace through the core material of the quarter.  As such, we have a few different structures:

## Structure 1: All-group direct instruction

Directly following standup we'll do a short all-group lesson.  These will focus on memorizing, understanding and analyzing concepts that are important to being good developers, such as:

- Binary and ASCII and UTF8
- Writing tests
- Talking about trees and graphs

This will ideally be no more than 45 minutes per day.

## Structure 2: Whiteboard interview preparation

You don't _really_ know how to code until you can code on a whiteboard, where you have to get it right _without_ the help of `console.log` and seeing values.  So you'll spend about an hour every day practicing and observing whiteboard interviews in groups.

## Structure 3: Individual practice

We've arranged a thorough and complete Learning Path for you, with test suites for every topic.

## Structure 4: Journaling

In order to optimize your performance, you'll need to develop some meta-cognition.  Journaling is an excellent tool for that.
