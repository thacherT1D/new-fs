TODO:

- Create a repo with a test suite
- Take each one of these refactoring techniques and come up with 5-10 examples of the non-refactored case
- Build tests for all of them and have the tests pass on master
- Build a solutions branch with the refactored case
- Make the test suite only pass if the git branch is not `master` :)
