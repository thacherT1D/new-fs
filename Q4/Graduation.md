Graduation is a simple ceremony.  Friends and family are welcome.  The general schedule looks like this:

- Eat / Drink / Mingle
- Your instructors will say a few words
- You'll be called up in alphabetical order to receive your parting gifts and certificate
- If you'd like, you may say a few words / share memories 💝
- That's IT!  Go forth and prosper!
