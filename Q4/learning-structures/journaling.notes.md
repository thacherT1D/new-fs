## Intro

When you intro journaling, give students a quick problem to solve, and have them work on it for 5 minutes.  The problem should be something like:

```
print the numbers 1-10, and 10-1 using a while loop, like so:

1   10
2   9
3   8
4   7
5   6
6   5
7   4
8   3
9   2
10  1

```

Then have them turn and talk to their neighbors to answer the questions on the journal.

Ask each person to record an entry in their journal for that 5-minute practice.

Ask for a few people to discuss what they put in their journal, and suggest things like:

- used chrome console (or repl.it or a file)
- wrote sandwich code
- wrote outside of a function, then
- where was this in their ZPD?  discuss what ZPD looks like
- did they talk to their neighbor?
- did they look it up online? <-- this is effectively cheating

## Talk about the rationale / importance

If you spend a lot of time in your ZPD, it will be a hard day.  It will feel draining and rough.  It will require a lot of breaks.  BUT!  You'll make progress.

If you are on the easy side of your ZPD, it's an easy day.  You'll make some progress, but it won't feel interesting.  You may be bored or lack motivation.

If you are above your ZPD, you may feel stressed and stubborn, stay in a rathole for a long time, and not accomplish much.  You may quit or give up.  You may get angry and start blaming others / computers for your problems.
