## What's the point?

The goal behind journaling is to **give yourself the data you need to make better practice decisions**.  If you develop good [metacognition](https://quickleft.com/blog/learn-best-developer/) about how you learn best, you will set yourself up for a lifetime of success in programming!

Learning more complicated algorithms, data structures and object-oriented programming can feel hard.  If you are doing it right, you'll constantly be pushing your boundaries and it may be hard to maintain perspective and/or motivation.  You may stubbornly stay in a rathole (way past your zone of proximal development) for hours, or you may avoid hard problems and just do things you are good at all day.

If you have the right data, you can make the right decisions. So the primary purpose of journaling is to make it so that if you feel weak in an area, you can analyze your practice habits and we can help you optimize for better performance.

One additional benefit is that when you are working with instructors, they can see what you've been working on and help coach you and direct you towards higher-value ways to spend time.

## How to Journal

At the end of every block of time, record the following information:

Field | Value
------|------
Activity | A brief description of the problem you were working on, or your goal for the next day
Time | How long you spent on that activity
ZPD | Was it 1) too easy, 2) just right (hard, but you persevered) or 3) so hard that you were unsuccessful and/or stressed
Technique | Did you do pomodoro?  Or "heads down"?  Did you watch videos first _then_ code?  Vice versa??
Outcome | Did you finish the thing you were working on?  Or did you leave to come back later?
Notes | Anything that struck you about this session, positive or negative.

## Whiteboard Interview Results

There's a separate tab for whiteboard interview results.  This is to make sure that you have gotten the repetition you need on whiteboard interviews, and that you can pick a particular area where you need to get stronger and then see measurable improvement.
