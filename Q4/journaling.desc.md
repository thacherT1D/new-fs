## What's the point?

Learning more complicated algorithms, data structures and object-oriented programming can feel hard.  If you are doing it right, you'll constantly be pushing your boundaries and it may be hard to maintain perspective and/or motivation.

So the primary purpose of journaling is to make it so that if you feel weak in an area, you can analyze your practice habits and we can help you optimize for better performance.

The secondary purpose is so that instructors can easily see what you've been up to given that there will be large blocks of unstructured time.

## How to Journal

At the end of every block of time, record the following information:

Field | Value
------|------
Activity | A brief description of the problem you were working on
Time | How long you spent on that activity
ZPD | Was it 1) too easy, 2) just right (hard, but you persevered) or 3) so hard that you were unsuccessful and/or stressed
Outcome | Did you finish the thing you were working on?  Or did you leave to come back later?
Notes | Anything that struck you about this session, positive or negative.

## Whiteboard Interview Results

There's a separate tab for whiteboard interview results.  This is to make sure that you have gotten the repetition you need on whiteboard interviews, and that you can pick a particular area where you need to get stronger and then see measurable improvement.
