# Learning Path for Q4

A huge part of Q4 will be spent just writing code and more code and moar code.  You will all be in such different places when it comes to algorithms that it doesn't make sense to do big lectures to the whole class, so instead much of the data structures and algorithms will be done on your own and in small groups, but with copious test suites to guide you.

The overall path looks like this:

1. Programming fundamentals review
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 1
  - LinkedLists
  - Stacks and Queues
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 1
  - Basic state and behavior
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 2
  - Higher order functions
  - Recursion
  - Binary Trees
  - Trees
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 2
  - More complicated state / behavior
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 3
  - Binary search
  - Sorting algorithms
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 4
  - Graphs
  - Tries
  - Hash Tables

## 3 Parts to "The Learning Path"

There are 3 parts to the path:

**Mainline Activities**

These are the activities that everyone should do.  In most cases, we advise that after finishing, you take a break, burn it down, and do it again.  You want fluency and automaticity here, so redoing exercises is a great use of time.  Chances are they are so complex you can't memorize / regurgitate the answer - you'll have to figure it out again :)

**Further Practice**

At times we provide alternate exercises for further practice if you want other opportunities to develop automaticity and fluency.

**Stretch**

These are generally pretty hard.  Only do them if you pretty much crushed the other stuff, and feel like you can still cover the material coming up in time.

## Timing

Whenever there is individual work on the calendar, The Learning Path should be your first priority.
