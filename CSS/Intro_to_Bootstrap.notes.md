# Bootstrappin

**(I Do)**
## First Lecture

* Introduce Bootstrap
* Why does bootstrap exist
* What does bootstrap do
* Show the documentation
> Students read and do the 'installing section'

* Talk about grid systems (from the grid system exercise) Demo with link >>
* https://wireframe.cc/GuRoUr
* Livecode outline
	* Create a blank HTML page
		*  Add the bootstrap assets
        * Show grids of various sizes
        * Show utility classes
        * Livecode a mockup from earlier exercises
        * Show how to approach a mockup- problem solving strategies.
        * Make a list of everything you see, start with the "biggest" or easiest thing you can think to do. Then build from there. Show also drawing boxes around a mockup.
	* Explain the Grid System
        * Explain style resetting
        * Explain more sensible defaults
        * Explain buttons and other content



**(We Do)**  
Students should go through the walkthrough and install their own copy of bootstrap. They'll get a chance to play with the grid system before creating their own pages from mockups.  


**(They Do)**  
They'll be creating pages from mocks, starting with https://github.com/gSchool/bootstrap_mocks_assignment. They should finish this as their assignment.
https://github.com/gSchool/bootstrap-challenge is Homework.

**Mention other CSS frameworks

- Foundation
- Semantic-UI
- Material Design Lite
- Angular Material

## Checks for understanding
Being able to create a page from a mockup shows they have enough familiarity with the concepts to get a 2, finishing all the mockups shows a 3, a polished design or more is a 4.
