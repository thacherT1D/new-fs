On Day 1 give a short morning lesson touching on standards and a general overview of server side languages/frameworks that are out there.

The overview lesson is followed by an intro to Ruby on Rails.

We then release the students for the day on this repo:

https://github.com/kylecoberly/coursework.galvanize.com

The students goals are to have Ruby on Rails installed/running and coursework.galvanize.com installed/seeded/running locally.

Once the site is running locally, the students should implement a feature and submit a pull request.

On Day 2 we let the students choose any other language except for JavaScript/Ruby and have them get a working hello world in that language and then a basic api up/running and deployed. A push is to have the students add a feature/fix a bug in an open source project that is in another language.
