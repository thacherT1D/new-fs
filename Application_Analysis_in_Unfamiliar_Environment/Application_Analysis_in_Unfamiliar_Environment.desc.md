# Application Analysis in Unfamiliar Environments

---

## Standards and Objectives:

- Set up developer environments for applications written in an unfamiliar languages
  - Install all necessary dependencies and start attached services 
  - Local database is created and populated
  - Application starts and all “working” features are usable

- Analyze existing code in applications written in unfamiliar languages to fulfill requirements
  - Fixes bugs in existing, unfamiliar code (at least 1)
  - Adds features to fulfill requirements (at least 1)

## Action Plan

1. Choose a Language

1. Setup Development Environment

1. Write/Compile/Run Hello World

1. Fix a bug in an existing project

1. Implement a feature in an existing project

1. Build and Deploy a Web Service/Application

# Research Languages and Frameworks that Interest You

 - Check Job Posting websites to get a feel for language/framework popularity
 - Search reddit.com/r/programming reddit.com/r/webdev etc
 - Find top frameworks on github

---

# Setup Development Environment

---

- Find Relevant Docker Image
- Find Relevant VM Ware/Virtualbox Image
- Install the SDK/Setup Development Environment
- Choose an IDE: Visual Studio, Eclipse, InteliJ, XCode

---

# Familiarize yourself with the Language
 - Official Tutorials
 - Official Documentation
 - StackOverflow Questions
 - CodeSchool etc.
 - You don't have to learn the whole language, just learn enough to be productive

# Write/Compile/Run Hello World

---

# PUSH

---

# Write a Web Service

- Use an existing project/example
 
 - translate to new language
 
 - recognize commonalities
 
 - API endpoints should be the same
 
 - front end client should not care what the back end language is

---

# Deploy a Web Service

- Deploy to a service you have not yet used
 
 - AWS
 
 - IBM Bluemix
 
 - run.pivotal.io
 
 - Google Cloud
 
 - Azure

# Where to look for help

- Practice Search Engine Foo (Google Foo)
- Stack Exchange/Stack Overflow
- Language/Framework Specific Sub-reddit
- Google Groups/Forums
- Other Forums/Q&A Websites
