## What's interface and User Interface Design?

An **interface** is a shared boundary across which two separate entities exchange information. In computing, an interface is the bridge between the immaterial world that exists in code and the material world that we physically interact with. We provide input to the immaterial world through devices like a keyboard, mouse, trackpad, or touch screen.

**User interface design** is the implementation of these interfaces with a focus on user experience. The end goal of user interface design is to make the user's interactions as efficient as possible. UI design combines concepts from various fields such as visual design, interaction design, and information architecture.

Simple is better. A good interface is essentially invisible to the user, in the way that the user doesn't have to waste time searching for controls or dealing with unhelpful error messages.

Maintaining consistency and predictability for any given user will increase overall task completion, satisfaction, and efficiency.

### Interface Elements

Once a user is familiar to elements on one page or section, they should be able to use any of the other interface components with ease. Over time, most users have also become accustomed to how certain elements interact and behave.

There are many common visual elements that help form an interface, including but not limited to:

#### Input Elements

A good interface has consistent usage and appearance of input and control elements. Some examples include the HTML5 form elements `<button>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, etc.

#### Navigation

A well designed interface employs common design patterns for navigation that are intuitive or are already familiar to the user. Is the main navigation on the top or bottom, left or right? Is it centered or aligned? Does it change to an icon on mobile? Does the appearance change if a user is logged in?

#### Informational Elements

Elements such as tool tips, notifications, modals, error/alert messages, etc. help display useful information and can reduce frustration and effectively communicate status.

### Simple Interface Principles

#### Layout

The layout of a page or application should be intentional and logically arranged. Separation of concerns also applies to the visual aspect of an interface and aids in readability.

Consider the spatial relationships between items to help inform your structural decisions. The hierarchy of information and grouping should remain similar and fluid when designing for responsiveness.

#### Color and/or Texture

Attention can be directed/redirected with an effective usage of color, contrast, texture, pattern, etc. Use contrasting colors for important information or calls to action.

#### Hierarchical Typography

As with color choices, type choices should be meaningful and logical as well. A large range of fonts can be created by varying size, style, weight, typeface, color, arrangement, etc.

Not only does this create a pleasing aesthetic but it also helps with overall readability and consistency.

> Pro Tip: Most designers typically follow a general rule of using a maximum of two typefaces on a given project. Using only two typefaces doesn't mean you only have access to two fonts though.

>The variance of *typeface*, *style*, and *size* is what creates a unique font.
