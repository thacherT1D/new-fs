## Objectives
- Create thumbnail sketches for quick prototyping lots of ideas
- Describe content inventories and use them to support wireframing
- Understand common wireframe conventions (lorem ipsum, boxes with x's for images, [callout notes](http://uxmovement.com/wireframes/why-its-important-to-annotate-your-wireframes/), etc)
- Create wireframes to help guide application development

## What is a wireframe?

* Wireframes describe layout
* Not content, not polish, not color
* Not mockups
* One of the tools for capturing requirements

## Information Architecture

### Content Inventories

* Make a list of all of the things your site should have
    * Images
    * Text
    * Navigation

### Information Hierarchy

* Understand the relationship between the things in your content inventory
* What's important
* What goes together
* "Information Architecture"


## Thumbnail Sketches

* Fast! 10 seconds or less
* Macro-layout
* Don't stay married to a design

## Building a Wireframe

* Placeholders
* Relationships
* Micro-interactions (how the user interacts with your content, and how their interactions affect the page.)

## Grids
https://css-tricks.com/dont-overthink-it-grids/

* 12-column grids
* Gutters
* Ratios
* Draw on top of the grid

## Design for the web

* Design for flow
* Ignore the vertical
* "Mobile First"

## Markup

* What are all of the elements, semantically?
* What containers do they have?
* Box model

## Exercise
BlueWing Real Estate is looking to create a web application for home buyers. They want users to be able to register, search for houses and save them to their dashboards. You will need to create several wireframes. Follow this process to create a landing page wireframe:

1.  Write a content inventory
2.  Create 10 quick sketches (on paper or whiteboard)
3.  Pick 2 to make into wireframes
4.  Create both wireframes using your choice of wire-framing tool.
