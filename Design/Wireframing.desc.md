## Objectives
 * Explain the difference between a wireframe and a mockup
 * Create simple wireframes as part of project planning process

## What is a Wireframe
A wireframe is an illustration of a page’s interface, focusing on space allocation, content priority, functionality, and intended behaviors. For these reasons, wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics. Wireframes also help establish relationships between a website’s various templates.

## The Value of Wireframes

## Creating Basic Wireframes

Standard Elements to consider when starting a wireframe:
* Headers
* Navigation(s)
* Body content
* Share Buttons
* Contact information
* Footer


## Types of Wireframes
* **Low Fidelity** wireframes are most often black and white, drawn (usually by hand) in a basic manner, showing some of the basic nature of the planned content using simple images, space blocks, and filler text, such as lorem ipsum. These help to facilitate planning and team communication.
* **Mid/High-fidelity** wireframes are a much more refined version, beginning to include digital versions, approximations of copy and content, planned behaviours and interactive elements.
* **Mockups** are wireframes with visual skinning, such as color, typography, images, and more exact layouts. These can also include the code specifications.

## Content Inventory & Hierarchy



## Exercise
 * Pick a website and reverse engineer the wireframe
 * Sketch two wireframes:
    * a web developer portfolio homepage
    * a shopping cart page
 * For those write a content inventory & hierarchy
 * Then create wireframes on grid
