## Exercise
BlueWing Real Estate is looking to create a web application for home buyers. They want users to be able to register, search for houses and save them to their dashboards. You will need to create several wireframes. Follow this process to create a landing page wireframe:

Create 10 quick sketches (on paper or whiteboard)
Pick 2 to make into wireframes
For those 2, write a content inventory
Create both wireframes using your choice of wire-framing tool.
