- Create simple wireframes as part of project planning process

## What is a Wireframe
A wireframe is an illustration of a page’s interface, focusing on space allocation, content priority, functionality, and intended behaviors. For these reasons, wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics. Wireframes also help establish relationships between a website’s various templates.

## The Value of Wireframes
Wireframes are a great place to get started with any project because they help you and your team to outline a concrete idea of what you are going to build. Additionally, they can serve to:
- Determine priority of content and features
- Clarify consistent ways of displaying different types of information
- Confirm design intended functionality

## Types of Wireframes

**Low Fidelity** wireframes are most often black and white, drawn (usually by hand) in a basic manner, showing some of the basic nature of the planned content using simple images, space blocks, and filler text, such as lorem ipsum. These help to facilitate planning and team communication.


- **Mid/High-fidelity** wireframes are a much more refined version, beginning to include digital versions, approximations of copy and content, planned behaviours and interactive elements.
- **Mockups** are wireframes with visual skinning, such as color, typography, images, and more exact layouts. These can also include the code specifications.

## Creating Basic Wireframes
The goal of wireframes is guide where major navigation and content elements of your site are going to be placed, not to illustrate your site's design. Starting with a low fidelity
- Stick to black and white
- No images, instead use a rectangle box sized to dimension with an "x" through it
- In most cases, stick to paper and pen -- at least at first, moving to digital usually will go hand in hand with creating a more detailed Mid to High-fidelity wireframe

Standard Elements to consider when starting a wireframe:
- Headers
- Navigation(s)
- Body content
- Share Buttons
- Contact information
- Footer


## Exercise
- Pick a website and reverse engineer the wireframe
- Sketch two wireframes:
  - a web developer portfolio homepage
  - a shopping cart page
