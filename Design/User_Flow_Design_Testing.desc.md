## Objectives

- What is a User Story
- What is User Flow
- Explain what a site map is
- Draw the site map and wireframes one project idea
- Work with a classmate to test the user story of each of your ideas

## What is a User Story?

You create or understand the user story by answering questions about who your user is and why, when, and how would they use your product.

## What is User Flow?

User flow is how the user is guided to navigate around your site. This can be done explicitly or implicitly through many different design elements, such as navigation and menus, buttons, fonts, colors, etc. There can be more than a single user flow, for example when there are multiple features, but the focus should always be on the primary user flow.

## Exercise - Framing Your Idea
For this project (or just this activity) choose a problem/pain point, data set, or game/art experience as your starting point and then answer the following questions:
- Who is your primary user? (i.e. who would use your product?)
- In what context? when?
- How would your user use your product/solution?

## An Example Idea
**Your Idea/Starting Point**
I wish I knew when a flight was at its cheapest without having to check a website.

**Who is your primary user?**
Cynthia is a mid-20s adventurer who works for a non-profit. May is always slow season at work so she wants to plan an adventure in spite of her tight budget.

**In what context? when?**
It’s January, Cynthia is sitting at her work computer dreaming of being on the beach. She has some time to order her tickets, but wants to start exploring now.

**List (or Draw) the steps of your primary use case. How would your user use your product/solution?**
1. Cynthia goes to a homepage
1. She enters in information about her approximate travel dates
1. She notices her departure city is pre-populated with her current location and leaves that selection
1. Cynthia presses enter
1. Cynthia sees a page of potential trips
1. After scrolling through results, she presses a button to set up auto alerts


## What is a Site Map?

A sitemap gives you a good sense for all of the pages that you will need to build and how they interconnect. User flows can dictate the structure of your site map, with primary user flows helping dictate the first stages of your site map and secondary/tertiary user flows helping round out some of the pages you may not have initially thought of.

**Site Maps Turn into Wireframes**
Once you create a site map, you can start filling in each of the pages with more of a wireframe sketch. Using a site map isn't always necessary, but it is helpful when working on a system with many pages. Think of it as an overview that lets you see consistent patterns across the system.

## Exercise - Create Your Site Map

Take a few minutes to think about the user flow of your site and map it out with a simple diagram.

## Exercise - Create Your Wireframes

Using your site map and what we have learned about UI Design and Wireframing, create your wireframes for this idea (2-5 wireframes for the needs of this exercise)

## Test Your User Story
Take turns with a classmate to test your ideas.
1. Describe the primary user that you would like your classmate to play and assign them a task to complete
  - For the example above, we might tell a partner: You are now Cynthia. Cynthia doesn’t care where she’s going, but has free time in May and is on a budget to travel. Cynthia’s task is to set up a travel alert for cheap trips in May.
1. Ask your classmate to speak aloud as they “click” each one of your screens. What do they expect they will see next? Take notes. Observe pauses, Remind your classmate to speak their thoughts aloud.
1. After your classmate has completed the given task, take 1-2 minutes to record feedback. How can you change your wireframe to make completing this task more intuitive?
