## Technical Terms

Sketch
> An incredibly brief visual representation of a website. Sketches are usually done by hand but, more importantly, they are quick.

Wireframe
> A wireframe is slightly more complex than a sketch but only in that it solidifies ideas in a presentable format. Wireframes are about content and structure, not design or detail.
