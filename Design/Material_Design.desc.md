## What's Material Design?

**Material Design** is a visual language, developed by Google, inspired by the study of paper and ink. It uses typography, grids, space, scale, depth, color, and motion to form a user interface that gives hierarchy, meaning, and focus to content.

To see it in action, watch this video on [Material Design by Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw)

To learn more details, check out the [documentation on Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/environment.html)

### Exercise

After having explored the above resources, turn to a partner and explain what Material Design is in your own words.

## Why is Material Design useful?

Not only can web developers use Material Design to create a stunning, unified experience across platforms and device sizes, they can use it help close the gap between their taste versus their abilities.

To learn more about it, watch this video on [The Gap by Ira Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ResTHKVxf4)

### Exercise

After having explored the above resource, take a moment and write down your thoughts on how you've been perceiving your own gap.

## What's the Material framework?

A **framework** is software that provides a generic template of functionality which can be selectively changed and enhanced by writing additional code. **Materialize** is a modern, responsive, front-end framework based on Material Design. In short, Materialize has done most of the heavy lifting for you in terms of a cohesive visual language. Materialize provides a default set of stylized components that you can incorporate into your own application and tweak as necessary.

To see it in action, check out some of these components.

### Exercise

After having explored the above resources, turn to a partner and explain what Materialize is in your own words.

## How does the Materialize framework compare against its competition?

Having received nearly 20,000 stars in GitHub, Materialize fairs quite well when evaluated against its hundreds of rival competitors. Although, Materialize definitely takes a back seat when compared to Bootstrap and Foundation, the two largest and most popular front-end frameworks. These two frameworks are famous for providing everything plus the kitchen sink. However, this is a double-edged sword as they both have a steep learning curves. They also both require significant amounts of additional code to get their sites looking not-so drab out of the box.

In short, Materialize will help you produce better looking sites faster. And as a bonus, the skills you pick up while learning Materialize will help you figure out other front-end frameworks faster as well.

## How do you use the Materialize framework?

We'll use Materialize's [official documentation](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) to create a style guide that you can reference at any time.
