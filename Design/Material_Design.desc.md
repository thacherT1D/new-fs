## What's Material Design?

**Material Design** is a visual language, developed by Google, inspired by the study of paper and ink. It uses typography, grids, space, scale, depth, color, and motion to form a user interface that gives hierarchy, meaning, and focus to content.

To see it in action, watch this video on [Material Design by Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw)

To learn more details, check out the [documentation on Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/environment.html)

### Exercise

After having explored the above resources, turn to a partner and explain what Material Design is in your own words.

## Why is Material Design useful?

Not only can web developers use Material Design to create a stunning, unified experience across platforms and device sizes, they can use it help close the gap between their taste versus their abilities.

To learn more about it, watch this video on [The Gap by Ira Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ResTHKVxf4)

### Exercise

After having explored the above resource, take a moment and write down your thoughts on how you've been perceiving your own gap.

## What's the Material framework?

A **framework** is software that provides a generic template of functionality which can be selectively changed and enhanced by writing additional code. **Materialize** is a modern, responsive, front-end framework based on Material Design. In short, Materialize has done most of the heavy lifting for you in terms of a cohesive visual language. Materialize provides a default set of stylized components that you can incorporate into your own application and tweak as necessary.

To see it in action, check out some of these components.
