##Why does design matter?
The user interface (UI) of the apps that you build is, aptly named, the way the user interacts with your application. No matter how amazing your back-end design is, if your front-end doesn't convey that to the user they won't appreciate your work as much as it deserves.

To learn more about it, we are going to watch this video on [The Gap by Ira Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ResTHKVxf4)

### Exercise
Take a moment and write down your thoughts on how you've been feeling about your own gap.

##What is Material Design?
**Material Design** is a tool to help us design the UI of our applications. It is a visual language developed by Google that's inspired by the study of paper and ink. It uses typography, grids, space, scale, depth, color, and motion to form a user interface that gives hierarchy, meaning, and focus to content.

To see it in action, watch this video on [Material Design by Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw)


##What is the Materialize framework?
A **framework** is software that provides a generic template of functionality which can be selectively changed and enhanced by writing additional code. **Materialize** is a modern, responsive, front-end framework based on Material Design. In short, Materialize has done most of the heavy lifting for you in terms of a cohesive visual language. Materialize provides a default set of stylized components that you can incorporate into your own application and tweak as necessary.


##What is the grid
Arguable the most important part of any design framework is the grid. It is the foundation that will let you more easily learn frameworks like bootstrap and foundation. Let's take a look at it in action.

**Materialize components**
To see it in action, check out some of these components in the [Materialize Docs](http://materializecss.com/).

## Why are both Material Design and the Materialize framework useful?
Not only can web developers use both Material Design the Materialize framework to create a stunning, unified experience across platforms and device sizes, they can use them to help close the gap between their taste versus their abilities.

### Exercise
After having explored the above resources, turn to a partner and explain the difference between Material Design and Materialize.

## How does the Materialize framework compare against its competition?
Having received over [18,000 stars on GitHub](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize), Materialize fairs quite well when evaluated against its hundreds of rival competitors. However, Bootstrap and Foundation are currently the two largest and most popular front-end frameworks. These two frameworks are famous for providing everything plus the kitchen sink. While this sounds great on paper, it's actually a double-edged sword as they both have non-trivial learning curves. Also, both frameworks require web developers to write significant amounts of additional code to get their sites looking less drab right out of the box.

To see a comprehensive list of just their UI components, check out these links.

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/kitchen-sink.html)

In short, Materialize will help you produce better looking sites faster. And as a bonus, the skills you pick up while learning Materialize will help you figure out other front-end frameworks faster as well.

##Exercise
Review the following visuals and work with a partner to answer any questions you have before we review them together.

Here's the list of visuals we will review in more detail.

- [Color](http://materializecss.com/color.html)
- [Grid](http://materializecss.com/grid.html)
- [Shadow](http://materializecss.com/shadow.html)
- [Helpers](http://materializecss.com/helpers.html)

Here's the list of visuals we'll go over together at a glance.

- [Media](http://materializecss.com/media-css.html)
- [Cards](http://materializecss.com/cards.html)

## How do you use the Materialize framework?
We'll use Materialize's [official documentation](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) to create an initial document so you can see the different CSS options and components style guide that you can reference when building your assignment.
