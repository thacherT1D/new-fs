## Objectives

- Use the PostgreSQL REPL to manage tables in a database.
- Use the PostgreSQL REPL to manage rows in a table.

## How do you use the PostgreSQL REPL to manage tables in a database?

In addition to managing databases, the PostgreSQL REPL can also manage tables in the default PostgreSQL cluster. To display the tables in the current connected database, run the following REPL command.

```text
\dt
```

And you should see something like this.

**NOTE:** The word relation is a synonym for a table.

To create a `movies` table in the current connected database, run the following SQL command.

```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id serial,
  title text,
  duration integer,
  rating varchar(10),
  genre text,
  is_3d boolean NOT NULL,
  released_at timestamp with time zone,
  score numeric(3, 1)
);
```

**NOTE:** All SQL commands, like the one above, can be written on a single line. However, it can be useful to split up longer commands onto multiple lines.

And you should see something like this.

The above `CREATE TABLE` command is an example a multi-line SQL command. Notice how the yellow equals sign `=` of the prompt changed to a yellow open parenthesis sign `(`. This is a clue that the PostgreSQL REPL was waiting for the SQL command to provide a matching close parenthesis `)`.

To verify the table was created, display the tables in the current connected database by running the following REPL command.

```text
\dt
```

And you should see something like this.

In PostgreSQL, all databases contain a `public` schema which in turn contains tables, among other things. The most important thing to note, however, is that there a `movies` table and it has an owner.

To verify the table was created with the correct columns, run the following command.

```text
\d movies
```

And you should see something like this.

As you can see, the `movies` table contains a handful of columns. In a relational database system, all values in the same column must be the same data type. For example, a `integer` value can't be stored in a `text` column. This strictness is one of the reasons why a relational database system like PostgreSQL can remain performant while managing a massive collection of information.

Here's an overview of the most common data types in PostgreSQL.

| Name                                 | Storage Size | Description                               | Range                          |
|--------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `boolean`                            | 1 byte       | true or false                             | `t` or `f`                     |
| `integer`	                           | 4 bytes      | Typical choice for integer                | `-2147483648` to `+2147483647` |
| `numeric(precision, scale)`	         | variable     | Typical choice for decimal                | Precise	up to 131,072 digits before the decimal point and up to 16,383 digits after the decimal point |
| `timestamp with time zone`           | 8 bytes      | Date, time, and time zone                 | 4713 BC to 294276 AD           |
| `text`                               | variable     | Variable-length string, unlimited length  | N/A                            |
| `character varying(n)`, `varchar(n)` | variable     | Variable-length string, limited length    | N/A                            |
| `character(n)`, `char(n)`            | variable     | Fixed-length string, blank padded         | N/A                            |

One common data type that's missing from this table is the `serial` data type, which was used earlier for the `id` column of the `movies` table. The reason why it's missing is because the `serial` data type is not a true type. Rather, it's a notational convenience for creating a unique identifier column. When a `serial` column is declared, an `integer` column with a sequence generator and a `NOT NULL` constraint is created instead.

A **sequence generator** is a special, single-row table that's used for generating numbers in sequential order. A `serial` sequence generator starts with value of `1` and increments the value by `1` each time the generator is triggered.

To see the sequence generator for the `id` column of the `movies` table, run the following command.

```text
\d movies_id_seq
```

And you should see something like this.

![](https://i.imgur.com/MYG7YWb.png)

When an entity without an `id` value is inserted into the `movies` table, the column's sequence generator is triggered and the next value is given to the inserted entity's `id` attribute. If the entity is eventually deleted from the table, its `id` value is not reused. Therefore, each entity in the table is guaranteed to have a unique identifier forever. Almost every table you create will have an `id serial` column.

The `serial` type also applies a `NOT NULL` constraint to the column. Like JavaScript, the `NULL` value represents the absence of data. Unless a column is given a `NOT NULL` constraint, the `NULL` value is an acceptable value for any column no matter the data type. While a `serial` column is automatically given a `NOT NULL` constraint, it's wise to manually apply the constraint to `boolean` columns as well. For example, the `NOT NULL` constraint was applied to the `is_3d` column in the `movies` table.

While creating a table with the right columns is important, the structure of a table is not set in stone. For example, as a web application evolves over time, so too can its companion database tables.

To add a column to the `movies` table, run the following command.

```sql
ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN plot text;
```

Believe it or not, but there's a ton more you can do to manage tables. See the following articles to learn more about data types in PostgreSQL.

- [PostgreSQL Documentation - Arbitrary Precision Numbers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-NUMERIC-DECIMAL)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation - Character Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-character.html)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation - Date/Time Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-datetime.html)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation - Integer Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-INT)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation - Serial Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL)

See the following articles to learn more about column modifiers in PostgreSQL.

- [PostgreSQL Documentation - Not-Null Constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html#AEN2531)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation - Default Values](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-default.html)

And see the following articles to learn more about the SQL commands you practiced in PostgreSQL.

- [PostgreSQL Documentation - `CREATE TABLE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createtable.html)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation - `ALTER TABLE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-altertable.html)
- [PostgreSQL Documentation - `DROP TABLE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-droptable.html)

### Exercise

A **migration** is a file that contains SQL commands that are used to recreate the tables in a database on demand. In a `migration.sql` file, type out the `CREATE TABLE movies` SQL command from above. Then, add a `DROP TABLE` command at the top of the file so you can repeatedly execute the commands. Using the PostgreSQL documentation, figure how to prevent the `DROP TABLE` command from generating an error if the table doesn't exist.

To migrate the `movie_junkies_dev` database, run the following command from your shell.

```shell
psql movie_junkies_dev -f migration.sql
```

Iterate on your migration file until you can repeatedly run it without generating an error. Then, add the necessary SQL commands to migrate an `awards` table as well. Create this table with the necessary columns to support the following entities.

```text
 id | movie_id | kind  |                                 name                                 
----+----------+-------+----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1 |        1 | Oscar | Best Animated Feature Film of the Year                               
  2 |        1 | Oscar | Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Song
```

For each column, choose what you think is the most appropriate data type. When you're finished, migrate the database and use `\dt` REPL command to verify that the table was created correctly.

Finally, add an `ALTER TABLE` command to bottom of the migration file that'll add a column to the `awards` table to track whether or not the related movie received the award. In other words, the difference between being nominated and winning the award. For this column, you get to choose both its name and data type. When you're finished, migrate the database and use `\dt` REPL command to verify that the table was created correctly.

## How do you use the PostgreSQL REPL to manage rows in a table?

To insert a row into the `movies` table, run the following command.

```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, duration, rating, genre, is_3d, released_at, score) VALUES ('Frozen', 102, 'PG', 'Animation', TRUE, '2013-11-27 00:00:00 UTC', 7.6);
```

And you should see something like this.

![](https://students-gschool-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/205/Screen_Shot_2016-06-21_at_3.48.34_AM.png)

**NOTE:** The entity was automatically given a unique value for its `id` attribute.

Insert a few more rows into the `movies` table by running the following commands.

```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, duration, rating, genre, is_3d, released_at, score) VALUES ('X-Men: Apocalypse', 144, 'PG-13', 'Action', TRUE, '2016-05-27 00:00:00 UTC', 7.4);
INSERT INTO movies (title, duration, rating, genre, is_3d, released_at, score) VALUES ('The Princess Bride', 98, 'PG', 'Adventure', FALSE, '1987-10-09 00:00:00 UTC', 8.1);
INSERT INTO movies (title, duration, rating, genre, is_3d, released_at, score) VALUES ('Pulp Fiction', 154, 'R', 'Crime', FALSE, '1994-10-14 00:00:00 UTC', 8.9);
```

And you should see something like this.

### Exercises

A **seed** file contains SQL commands that are used to recreate the rows in a table on demand. In a `seed.sql` file, type out the four `INSERT INTO movies` SQL commands from above. Then, add a `DELETE FROM movies` command at the top of the file so you can repeatedly execute the commands. Using the PostgreSQL documentation, figure how to delete all the rows of the `movies` table in one command.

To seed the `movie_junkies_dev` database, run the following command from your shell.

```shell
psql movie_junkies_dev -f seed.sql
```

Iterate on your seed file until you can repeatedly run it without generating an error. Then, add SQL commands at the bottom of the file to do the following.

- Return the `id`, `title`, and `score` of the single lowest scoring movie in the table.
- Return the `id`, `title`, and `duration` of the "X-Men: Apocalypse" and "The Princess Bride" movies.
- Return the `id`, `title`, and `released_at` all the movies ordered by from oldest to newest.
- Return the `id`, `title`, `genre`, and `score` of all of the PG movies that scored between 7.5 and 8.5
- Add a half a point to the `score` of all Crime movies.
- Subtract 2 points from the `score` of all the 3-D movies.
- Delete all movies that have the word 'en' in their `title`.
