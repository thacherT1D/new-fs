We've previously stored complex data inside of arrays and objects. This information has been temporal; that is, as soon as we restart our program it is reset back to its starting value. Databases in general allow for **persistence**. In programming, when we talk about persistence we're talking about data (and the changes to that data) outliving any individual run of a program.

A relational database system, or relational database management system (RDBMS), is a database system that's based on the relational model. The relational model is an approach to managing information in a table structure (i.e. relation), where an entity is represented as a row and its attributes are represented as columns.

## Installing PostgreSQL

Instructions on installing PostgreSQL via Homebrew can [be found here.](https://github.com/gSchool/sql-curriculum/blob/master/Install%20-%20Homebrew.md)

## Introduction to Databases, SQL, and PostgreSQL

Before diving into using SQL, we'll want to better understand how databases work and what SQL and PostgreSQL are used for. Follow along with the [SQL Curriculum Intro Article](https://github.com/gSchool/sql-curriculum/blob/master/Intro.md).

## PostgreSQL Command Line Tools

To start, we will be interacting with our databases directly. We will later use JavaScript to interact with our databases. Follow along with the [SQL Curriculum PSQL Command Line Tools Article](https://github.com/gSchool/sql-curriculum/blob/master/PSQL.md).

## Entity Relationship Diagrams

Entity Relationship Diagrams, or ERDs, are a way of describing the relationships between various tables. This is a challenging but incredibly important (and fun!) topic.

You can follow along with the [SQL Curriculum ERD Article](https://github.com/gSchool/sql-curriculum/blob/master/Entity%20Relationship%20Diagrams.md) however this will also include some information we haven't gone over yet.

The following video will also give some context.

This video will describe SQL more generally and is a great primer for the content we'll cover moving forward.
