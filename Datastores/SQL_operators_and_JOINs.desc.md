Operators allow us to run evaluation in our SQL queries; for example, checking for equivalency. Joins allow us to query and return data from multiple tables at once using the database layer. This is better than combining records programmatically because it maintains separation of concerns allowing the JavaScript and database to both do what they're best at.
