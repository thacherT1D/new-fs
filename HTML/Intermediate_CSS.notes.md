## Instructor notes: 

Still need to cover:

HTML: conditional comments

CSS: Flexbox, Media queries, transitions, transforms, and animations.

Need more exercises, maybe work on flow between sections.

This LE used to have tables and dls- they were the only HTML thing in this section, so they got moved to semantic HTML.
