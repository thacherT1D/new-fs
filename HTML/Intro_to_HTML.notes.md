## First Lecture - HTML Syntax
**(I Do)**  

 * Basic overview of where in the stack HTML is / Show a webpage
 * Open pages, make a header and body and image - ask "if we're really just working all with text files, how do you think this page is stored? how does the document know to make the headers a certain size?"
 * Where would you keep that information in the document - open a blank text file and write the content in, and the link to the image, ask them to tell me things about the document, decide how to store it - "what would you do if you had to give instructions on how this content would be displayed?"
 * Show an HTML tag
 * Talk about the different parts of it
 	* cover tagname
 	* cover attributes
 * wrap the above page with some basic structure - coding "outwards in" by wrapping each piece of content.
        * show nesting tags with li
 	* talk about tabbing
 	* show tags like img, a
 	* talk about self-closing tags
 	* talk about attributes- lowercase names, no spaces between name, = and ""
 * Then wrap it in structure
        * Wrap a body around the content, add a head with some metadata. Keep the file!
        * make sure to have: `doctype, html, head, body, headers, p`
 	* open it in Chrome Dev Tools - tell them to keep it up always
 	
 	
What they're doing:

(**We Do**)  
Reading the walkthrough and following the prompts that takes them through making a page. Make sure they create a repository and get into the practice of committing everything always.

(**They Do**)  
Reading documentation and using it to create HTML tables in a new page.

## Second Lecture - Real-World HTML
Optional. Only if they take a full day to finish the They Do exercise. 
If they're absorbing material quick enough without prompting, the warm-up exercise will get them through validation and semantics can be covered during Forms.

 * Chrome Dev Tools check - are they all using it
 * Fancy HTML
	 * Talk about semantics
	 * Use an article tag on the index file we created in the first lecture
	 * Talk about validators
	 * Use a validator on the index file we created in the first lecture
	 * Talk about accessibility (screen readers, aria-labels, etc)
 * Explain the tree structure of HTML
 	* Talk about parent-child relationships, think of each thing as a "node"
 	* Talk about how you see trees every damn where in CS, get used to this vocabulary
 	* Ask anyone if they can come up with other examples of trees

## Checks for understanding
* What is an HTML tag?

* What is an HTML element?  Do all elements have closing tags?

* What is an HTML attribute?
