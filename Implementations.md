# WDI Specific Implementations

You are here to **learn how to solve problems well enough to get and keep a job as a software developer**.  That means learning to become:

- An excellent problem-solver
- A productive full stack developer
- Someone who can learn new things quickly

In order to stay current with the ever-changing tech industry, you'll likely work in several languages and dozens if not hundreds of frameworks.  Full stack developers need to know everything from CSS all the way through to databases and deployment.  So how should you choose what to learn first?

## It doesn't matter

You could learn how to become a software developer in any modern language (Java, C#, Closure, Go, Elm, TypeScript, Dart, PHP, Python etc...)  

## JavaScript is ubiquitous

Front end applications are still written predominantly in JavaScript (and all frontend code still compiles to JavaScript) so JavaScript is a must-learn programming language for modern web development.

According to [StackOverflow's 2016 Developer Survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#most-popular-technologies-per-occupation) JavaScript is an incredibly popular choice among developers.

## We chose JavaScript

Are you learning to be a Node developer?  A JS developer?  Not necessarily.  But you have to learn something real, and given its popularity, JS is a solid choice to learn.
