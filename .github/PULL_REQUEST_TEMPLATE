@gSchool/fsi-curriculum I propose that we change the following standards/success criteria.

Currently we have:

- Standard name
  - success criteria 1
  - success criteria 2
  - success criteria 3
- Standard name 2
  - success criteria 4
  - success criteria 5

I propose we make the final version:

- Standard name
  - success criteria 1
  - success criteria 5

(basically combine two standards into one, and merge 2 success criteria into one)

This pull request includes:

- [] changes to the YAML files (both the objectives and all related exercises, questions, etc...)
- [] a CHANGELOG entry describing the changes above
