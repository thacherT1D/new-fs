  We are currently transitioning this Learning Experience from Mongo to SQL/Knex.  Even though some videos reference Mongo, we recommend using SQL/Knex.

### Entry Ticket
In order to get this most out of this Learning Experience, you'll need to be comfortable with the following:

* [Express](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html)

### Overview
This learning experience covers most of the basic ideas you need to understand if you want users to be able to log in to your application. 

How often will you implement authentication from scratch in a job?  Not often, at least as a junior developer.

So why do we teach it?  Because it touches on a number of *hugely* important topics and challenges you to combine them with things you already know.  Things you'll touch on while learning to implement form-based authentication are:

- CRUD (creating users)
- Validations (displaying error messages like "invalid email / password")
- Cryptographic hashing
- Cookies and sessions

You will need to watch all of these videos in order to understand the concepts at play when we do authentication.

To get started, fork/clone the [Form Based Authentication](https://github.com/gSchool/form-based-authentication) repo.


## Video #1 - Cryptographic Hashing

How do we secure our user data? Knowing this basic information well will put you above most developers in terms of security knowledge (unfortunately). Pay close attention to the information in this video, or you might cause your new employer to [show up on this list](https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites).  

Follow instructions on the [Form-Based Authentication](https://github.com/gSchool/form-based-authentication) repo for the encryption routes.

This video is a great overview of how authentication is done in express.js. This video uses a different persistence layer, but the logic remains the same no matter what persistence layer you use. [Take a look at this example](https://github.com/gSchool/form-auth-with-express-knex-pg-bcrypt) for one using a more familiar persistence layer.

### Self-Assessment

Howâ€™d you do? Go back to the "Objectives" section. Go through each one and ask yourself:

- Have I completed this objective?
- What concrete evidence do I have that I've completed the objective?

Rate yourself 1 through 4 for each objective in terms of competence (4 being the highest). If you rate yourself a 2 or below, please notify an instructor for additional help.

Go to the "Key Terms" section.  For each term, ask yourself:

- What is my explanation for this term?

If you haven't completed an objective, or you can't define a term, take a few minutes to try to fill in any gaps.
