#Controllers

* Read the intro, then walk through parts of john-papas guide.
* Have students read up to the first exercise.
* Check for understanding...
* Demo a simple controller in a base application using 'controller as' syntax.
* Briefly intro how '$scope' and 'var vm = this;' work -- explain that we will dive deeper into this later, but that we're not going to use '$scope'.
