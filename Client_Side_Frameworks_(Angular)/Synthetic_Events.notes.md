## What's a synthetic event?

Now that you've gotten some practice with React's tools, let's build a sophisticated React application. For that, you'll need to learn about React's synthetic event system. A **synthetic event** is an object that wraps a browser's native event object. In other words, there's a JavaScript object inside of another JavaScript object.

```text
┌──── Synthetic event ───┐
│                        │
│   ┌─ Native event ─┐   │
│   │                │   │
│   │                │   │
│   └────────────────┘   │
│                        │
└────────────────────────┘
```

When a user interacts with a React user interface, a native event is generated by the browser as you would expect. However, React wraps the native event object with a [`SyntheticEvent`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html) object and passes it to an event handler as its first parameter. Here's an simple React application that handles an `onChange` synthetic event.

```jsx
const App = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { value: '' };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    // event is a SyntheticEvent object

    const nextState = { value: event.target.value };

    this.setState(nextState);
  },

  render() {
    return <input
      onChange={this.handleChange}
      type="text"
      value={this.state.value}
    />;
  }
});
```

As you can see, a `SyntheticEvent` object has the same properties as a browser's native event object including an `event.target` property. In the vast majority of cases, you won't need the underlying native event object. But if for some reason you ever do, you can access it via the `event.nativeEvent` property.

### Exercise

Turn to a neighbor and, in your own words, explain what a synthetic event is. After about a minute, your instructor will cold call on the class and ask what was discussed.

## Why is a synthetic event important?

The problem with native events is that they don't work exactly the same across all browsers. For example, handling native `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events has historically been a cross-browser pain point. The advantage of synthetic events is that they work *identically* across all browsers including IE9 and above. Understanding React's synthetic event system is critical, especially if you ever find yourself integrating React into an existing application. Thankfully, handling a synthetic event is similar to handling a native event. However, React does a few things under the hood to keep your user interfaces isolated, performant, and maintainable.

When React starts up, it attaches a single event listener onto the root `document` object of the DOM hierarchy. In React, you do *not* attach any additional event listeners to the DOM. If you find yourself reaching for functions like `EventTarget.addEventListener()` or `jQuery.on()` when building a React application from scratch, you're doing it wrong. You may, however, need to integrate a React user interface into an application with preexisting event listeners. The good news is that React's synthetic event system is completely isolated from the browser's native event system. This makes reasoning about your React user interface much easier.

To handle events in React, simply register an event handler with an event prop of an HTML component. This feels similar to registering an event handler with an event attribute of an HTML element. The only difference is that the event prop is written in camelcase.

**NOTE:** React's synthetic event system won't register an event handler with an event prop of a class component.

```jsx
const App = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { value: '' };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    // event is a SyntheticEvent object

    const nextState = { value: event.target.value };

    this.setState(nextState);
  },

  render() {
    return <input
      onChange={this.handleChange}
      type="text"
      value={this.state.value}
    />;
  }
});
```

In the above code example, the `<input />` component's event prop is `onChange` and the event handler is a reference to the `this.handleChange()` function. When the component is mounted or unmounted, the event handler is registered to or unregistered from React's own internal mapping.

When the `value` of the `<input />` component changes, a native event is fired and propagated through the DOM during the native capturing and bubbling phases.

```text

                     │                                ▲
                     ▼                                │
               ┏━━━━━━━━━━━┓                    ┏━━━━━━━━━━━┓
               ┃   input   ┃                    ┃   input   ┃
               ┗━━━━━━━━━━━┛                    ┗━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```


At the end of [the bubbling phase](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html), the native event reaches React's single event listener. The listener triggers its own internal event handler kicking off React's synthetic event system.

First, the internal event handler wraps the native event inside a `SyntheticEvent` object. Then the synthetic event is propagated through the component hierarchy using an [internal capturing and bubbling phase](http://codepen.io/ryansobol/pen/Lpvayw?editors=001). In this way, React ensures that a synthetic event is *identical* across all browsers in terms of both its properties and the way it's propagated.

```text

       ┌─────────┐                      ┌─────────┐
       │   App   │                      │   App   │
       └─────────┘                      └─────────┘
            │                                ▲
            ▼                                │
       ┏━━━━━━━━━┓                      ┏━━━━━━━━━┓
       ┃  input  ┃                      ┃  input  ┃
       ┗━━━━━━━━━┛                      ┗━━━━━━━━━┛
```

As the synthetic event propagates from component to component, it looks through their registered event handlers and triggers any that are bound to the event's name. All of the synthetic events covered in this chapter will trigger event handlers during the internal bubbling phase. Though it's rarely needed, React can trigger an event handler during the internal capturing phase too. To do so, simply register an event handler with an event prop that ends in the word `Capture` like `onChangeCapture`.

When an event handler is called, it's time for your code to shine. This is where you'll update a component's `this.state` object by using the `this.setState()` function. If you need to prevent the browser from loading a page as it follows an `href` or `action` URL on an `<a>` or `<form>` component, call the `event.preventDefault()` function inside the event handler.

```jsx
const App = React.createClass({
  handleClick(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    // The browser will no longer load the page at event.target.href
  },

  render() {
    return <a href="do-not-load.html" onClick={this.handleClick}>
      Do not load my href!
    </a>;
  }
});
```

And if you need to stop a synthetic event from propagating to other components during the internal bubbling phase, call the `event.stopPropagation()` function. However, this is pretty rare and you should only do it if there's a compelling reason.

**NOTE:** Returning `false` from a React event handler doesn't prevent the default behavior or stop event propagation. You'll need to call `event.preventDefault()` or `event.stopPropagation()` manually.

In this section, we've covered a bunch of technical information about React's synthetic event system. To summarize:

1. React's synthetic event system is completely isolated from the browser's native event system.
2. The synthetic event system works identically across all browsers.
3. Handling a synthetic event is similar to handling a native event.

## How do you use synthetic events to build an interactive React application?

In this article, you're going to practice how to handle synthetic events and how to leverage their properties in a variety of common use cases. React [supports a ton of synthetic events](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html#supported-events), but we're only going to focus on the most common ones.

- [Form events](#form-events)
  - [Textfield input](#textfield-input)
  - [Textarea](#textarea)
  - [Checkbox input](#checkbox-input)
  - [Radio input](#radio-input)
  - [Select drop-down](#select-drop-down)
  - [Form submission](#form-submission)
- [Focus events](#focus-events)
- [Mouse events](#mouse-events)
- [Keyboard events](#keyboard-events)

### Exercise

Type out the following code examples *by hand* and run them to make sure they work. Resist the urge to copy-and-paste!

**NOTE:** The surrounding HTML structure has been omitted on purpose. From here on out, you're responsible for implementing it.

## Form events

Form components such as `<input />`, `<textarea />`, and `<select>` differ from other native components because their state can be changed by a user. However, when a form component's state is set inside a React application, it's known as a **controlled component**.

```jsx
const element = <input type="text" value="I'm a controlled component." />;
```

The problem with this controlled component is that it renders a *read-only* element. In other words, a user cannot change the state living inside its `value` prop. To implement a form component that's both controlled by React and changeable by a user, you'll want to register an event handler with its `onChange` prop and set its state with a one-way data binding.

```jsx
const element = <input onChange={this.handleChange} type="text" value={this.state.value} />;
```

When a user changes the component's underlying element, its event handler is triggered. The handler can then update `this.state.value` and cause the component hierarchy to re-render the user interface. On most devices, this happens so fast that a user never perceives a delay.

The next few sections demonstrate the difference between controlled and uncontrolled form components in greater detail.

### Textfield input

When a user types a character into an `<input type="text" />` component, the `onChange` event will fire. You'll need to register an `onChange` event handler to share control over the component's `value` prop with your users.

**NOTE:** If you share control over the `value` prop but forget to also register an `onChange` event handler, the component will render as read-only and a warning will be sent to your browser's console.

```jsx
const TextfieldInput = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { value: "I'm changeable and under React's control" };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    const nextValue = event.target.value;

    this.setState({ value: nextValue });
  },

  render() {
    return <div>
      <input
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        type="text"
        value={this.state.value}
      />

      <input
        type="text"
        value="I'm read-only, am under React's control, but raise a warning."
      />

      <input
        type="text"
        defaultValue="I'm changeable but am not under React's control."
      />

      <input
        type="text"
        readOnly="true"
        value="I'm read-only and under React's control."
      />
    </div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <TextfieldInput />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

### Textarea

When a user types a character into a `<textarea />` component, the `onChange` event will fire. In HTML, the value of a `<textarea>` element is set by its children. In React, the `value` prop is used instead. You'll need to register an `onChange` event handler to share control over the component's `value` prop with your users.

**NOTE:** If you share control over the `value` prop but forget to also register an `onChange` event handler, the component will render as read-only and a warning will be sent to your browser's console.

```jsx
const Textarea = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { value: "I'm changeable and under React's control." };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    const nextValue = event.target.value;

    this.setState({ value: nextValue });
  },

  render() {
    return <div>
      <textarea
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        value={this.state.value}
      />

      <textarea
        value="I'm read-only, am under React's control, but raise a warning."
      />

      <textarea
        defaultValue="I'm changeable but am not under React's control."
      />

      <textarea
        readOnly="true"
        value="I'm read-only and under React's control."
      />
    </div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <Textarea />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

### Checkbox input

When a user clicks an `<input type="checkbox" />` component, the `onChange` event will fire. You'll need to register an `onChange` event handler to share control over the component's `checked` prop with your users.

**NOTE:** If you share control over the `checked` prop but forget to also register an `onChange` event handler, the component will render as read-only and a warning will be sent to your browser's console.

```jsx
const CheckboxInput = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { checked: false };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    const nextChecked = event.target.checked;

    this.setState({ checked: nextChecked });
  },

  render() {
    return <div>
      <div>
        {"I'm changeable and under React's control."}
        <input
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          type="checkbox"
          checked={this.state.checked}
        />
      </div>

      <div>
        {"I'm read-only, am under React's control, but raise a warning."}
        <input type="checkbox" checked={true} />
      </div>

      <div>
        {"I'm changeable but am not under React's control."}
        <input type="checkbox" defaultChecked={true} />
      </div>

      <div>
        {"I'm read-only and under React's control."}
        <input type="checkbox" readOnly="true" checked={true} />
      </div>
    </div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <CheckboxInput />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

### Radio input

When a user clicks an `<input type="radio" />` component, the `onChange` event will fire. In HTML, you manage groups of radio elements using a shared value for the `name` attribute. In React, you manage groups with one-way data bindings instead. You'll need to register an `onChange` event handler to share control over the component's `checked` prop with your users.

**NOTE:** If you share control over the `checked` prop but forget to also register an `onChange` event handler, the component will render as read-only and a warning will be sent to your browser's console.

```jsx
const RadioInput = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { value: 'no' };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    const nextValue = event.target.value;

    this.setState({ value: nextValue });
  },

  render() {
    return <div>
      <div>
        {"We're changeable and under React's control."}
        <input
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          type="radio"
          checked={this.state.value === 'yes'}
          value="yes"
        />
        <input
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          type="radio"
          checked={this.state.value === 'no'}
          value="no"
        />
      </div>

      <div>
        {"We're read-only, are under React's control, but raise a warning."}
        <input type="radio" name="1" checked={true} value="yes" />
        <input type="radio" name="1" checked={false} value="no" />
      </div>

      <div>
        {"We're changeable but are not under React's control."}
        <input type="radio" name="2" defaultChecked={true} value="yes" />
        <input type="radio" name="2" defaultChecked={false} value="no" />
      </div>

      <div>
        {"We're read-only and are under React's control."}
        <input type="radio" name="3" readOnly="true" checked={true} value="yes" />
        <input type="radio" name="3" readOnly="true" checked={false} value="no" />
      </div>
    </div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <RadioInput />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

### Select drop-down

When a user selects a new `<option>` from a `<select>` component, the `onChange` event will fire. You'll need to register an `onChange` event handler to share control over the component's `value` prop with your users.

**NOTE:** If you share control over the `value` prop but forget to also register an `onChange` event handler, the component will render as read-only and a warning will be sent to your browser's console.

```jsx
const SelectDropDown = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { value: 'B' };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    const nextValue = event.target.value;

    this.setState({ value: nextValue });
  },

  render() {
    return <div>
      <div>
        {"I'm changeable and under React's control."}
        <select onChange={this.handleChange} value={this.state.value}>
          <option value="A">Apple</option>
          <option value="B">Banana</option>
        </select>
      </div>

      <div>
        {"I'm read-only, am under React's control, but raise a warning."}
        <select value="B">
          <option value="A">Apple</option>
          <option value="B">Banana</option>
        </select>
      </div>

      <div>
        {"I'm changeable but am not under React's control."}
        <select defaultValue="B">
          <option value="A">Apple</option>
          <option value="B">Banana</option>
        </select>
      </div>

      <div>
        {"I'm read-only but under React's control."}
        <select readOnly={true} value="B">
          <option value="A">Apple</option>
          <option value="B">Banana</option>
        </select>
      </div>
    </div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <SelectDropDown />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

### Form submission

When a user submits a `<form>` component, the `onChange` event will fire. You'll need to register an `onSubmit` event handler that calls the `event.preventDefault()` function to prevent the browser from reloading the page.

**NOTE:** In terms of their events, `<input type="text" />` and `<input type="password" />` components are identical. Because each component has a unique `name` prop, the `this.handleChange()` event handler can be registered with both components.

```jsx
const FormSubmission = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { json: 'null', password: '', username:'' };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    const nextState = {};

    nextState[event.target.name] = event.target.value;

    this.setState(nextState);
  },

  handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    const nextJSON = JSON.stringify({
      password: this.state.password,
      username: this.state.username
    });

    this.setState({ json: nextJSON });
  },

  render() {
    return <div>
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        Username:
        <input
          name="username"
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          type="text"
          value={this.state.username}
        />

        Password:
        <input
          name="password"
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          type="password"
          value={this.state.password}
        />

        <input type="submit" value="Log in" />
      </form>

      <pre>JSON: '{this.state.json}'</pre>
    </div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <FormSubmission />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

## Focus events

When a user gives focus to a component, thus removing focus from another, the `onFocus` and `onBlur` events will fire on their respective components.

```jsx
const FocusAndBlur = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { value: "I'm blurred :(" };
  },

  handleBlur() {
    const nextValue = "I'm blurred :(";

    this.setState({ value: nextValue });
  },

  handleFocus() {
    const nextValue = "I'm focused :D";

    this.setState({ value: nextValue });
  },

  render() {
    return <div>
      <input
        onBlur={this.handleBlur}
        onFocus={this.handleFocus}
        readOnly={true}
        value={this.state.value}
      />
    </div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <FocusAndBlur />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

## Mouse events

When a user clicks on a component or moves the cursor across a component, the `onClick` or `onMouseMove` events will fire respectively.

When the user moves the cursor between two components, the `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events will fire on their respective components. These events only propagate from the underlying element being left to the one being entered.

**NOTE:** The `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events do *not* have an ordinary bubbling phase and do *not* have a capturing phase at all. This is because handling these events across nested components [can get complicated](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_mouse.html#link8) real fast.

```jsx
const Mouse = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return {
      clicks: 0,
      location: null,
      pageX: null,
      pageY: null
    };
  },

  handleClick() {
    const nextClicks = this.state.clicks + 1;

    this.setState({ clicks: nextClicks });
  },

  handleMouseEnter() {
    this.setState({ location: 'Entered' });
  },

  handleMouseLeave() {
    this.setState({ location: 'Left' });
  },

  handleMouseMove(event) {
    const nextState = {
      pageX: event.pageX,

## Keyboard events

When a user presses down and releases up a key on a focusable component, the `onKeyDown` and `onKeyUp` events will fire respectively. The `onKeyDown` event will repeatedly fire as long as the key is held down.

**NOTE:** The native focusable components are `<button>`, `<input />`, `<select>`, and `<textarea />`.

When a user presses a key *and* a character is inserted into a focusable component, the `onKeyPress` event will fire. The `onKeyPress` event will fire repeatedly as long as the key is pressed down and a character is inserted. Keys like Escape, Shift, Control, and Alt can't be inserted into a component. To handle these key presses, you'll need to register an event handler with a component's `onKeyDown` event prop instead.

Typically, the registered event handlers will respond to keys in different ways. For that, you'll need compare the value of `event.which` with an expected code. When the `onKeyDown` and `onKeyUp` events are fired, `event.which` contains a **key code** number which represents an actual key on the keyboard. When the `onKeyPress` event is fired, `event.which` contains a **character code** number which represents the key's UTF-8 character.

Here's a table that explains the difference between a key code and a character code.

| Key    | Key code | Character code |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| a      | 65       | 97             |
| A      | 65       | 65             |
| Return | 13       | 13             |
| Escape | 27       | N/A            |

**NOTE:** As of Firefox v42 and React v0.14, pressing the Escape key will sometimes stop React from executing. I haven't figure out why this happens, but you can fix it by calling the  `event.preventDefault()` function in your event handler. Other browsers like Chrome don't have this problem and calling the `event.preventDefault()` function has no effect on them.

```js
handleKeyDown(event) {
  if (event.which === 27) {
    event.preventDefault();
    // continue handling the event
  }
}
```

Here's a table to help you quickly remember which event does what.

| Event        | Trigger(s)                                  | `event.which`  |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `onKeyDown`  | When pressed down. Repeats while holding.   | Key code       |
| `onKeyPress` | When inserted. Repeats while inserting.     | Character code |
| `onKeyUp`    | When released up.                           | Key code       |

In summary, use `onKeyPress` to handle insertable key presses and `onKeyDown` to handle non-insertable key presses.

```jsx
const Keyboard = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return { events: [], value: '' };
  },

  handleChange(event) {
    const nextValue = event.target.value;

    this.setState({ value: nextValue });
  },

  handleClick() {
    this.setState({ events: [], value: '' });
  },

  handleKeyDown(event) {
    const nextEvents = this.state.events;

    nextEvents.push('Key Down: ' + event.which);

    this.setState({ events: nextEvents });
  },

  handleKeyPress(event) {
    const nextEvents = this.state.events;

    nextEvents.push('Key Press: ' + event.which);

    this.setState({ events: nextEvents });
  },

  handleKeyUp(event) {
    const nextEvents = this.state.events;

    nextEvents.push('Key Up: ' + event.which);

    this.setState({ events: nextEvents });
  },

  render() {
    const eventEls = this.state.events.map(function(event, index) {
      return <div key={index}>{event}</div>;
    });

    return <div>
      <textarea
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        onKeyDown={this.handleKeyDown}
        onKeyPress={this.handleKeyPress}
        onKeyUp={this.handleKeyUp}
        value={this.state.value}
      />

      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Clear
      </button>

      <h2>History</h2>

      {eventEls}
    </div>
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <Keyboard />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

## Summary

In this chapter, you learned how to make React applications more interactive. Specifically, you'll learned how React's synthetic event system works identically across all browsers. You also learned how to handle synthetic events and how to leverage their properties in a variety of common use cases. Believe it or not, but this chapter only begins to scratch the surface of all the [supported events and properties](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html#supported-events) in React.
