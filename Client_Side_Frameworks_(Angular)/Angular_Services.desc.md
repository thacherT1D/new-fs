## Objectives

* Explain what an Angular service is.
* Explain why an Angular service is important.
* Implement an Angular service.
* Inject a custom Angular service into an Angular controller.

## What is an Angular service?

In addition to filters, and controllers, Angular provides a feature called **services**. As we start building larger applications with multiple controllers, not only is our code per controller becoming larger, but we are starting to face with a new problem. How do we share data, properties and methods between controllers?

Angular services are features that serve the purpose of abstracting data logic away from your controllers and even other services. Services provide a place to store information that can be accessed by different controllers and directives. You may find services helpful in doing the following:

* Making a request to your server for data or hitting a public API.
* A collection of methods or logic that is used in multiple controllers. This allows you to follow the philosophy of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY).

Any data stored in a controller is lost when you change to another controller.
Services on the other hand will persist data between controllers. This is because while many instances of the same controller type may exist, there will always be at most one instance of a service that is shared. This programming design is called a _singleton_ where we ensure that only one instance is created.

## Why is an Angular service important?

When building controllers, it's important to restrict the scope of the controller to a specific area of a webpage. For example, you may tie the catalog page for a shopping site to a specific controller while you may create a controller to manage the cart. In terms of separating concerns, this makes sense splitting the two responsibilities. However, these controllers are interlinked some how. A user may click a button to add an item to the cart in the catalog which, in this case, requires knowledge of the cart.

A service provides information to share between the two (or more) controllers. In this case, the catalog controller is interacting with a service designed to manager the items in the cart. The cart controller is then grabbing information from that service to help display information.

In other words, the service allows the ability for two controllers to _communicate_ with each other.

## How do you implement an Angular service?

In Angular, there three different ways to implement a service, they are:

* A factory
* A service
* A provider

The important types we will cover are **factories** and **services**. It's a bit tricky since all these options fall under the umbrella, services, but for the most part these serve very similar purposes with different representations.

### *Service* Service

Using the service API, you create a class that represents the service. Behind the scenes, Angular calls `new` on your class to create an instance. This instance is set as the *singleton instance* that will be injected into our controllers.

Here is an example service using the class syntax.

```js
// person.service.js
class PersonService {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "Matt";
    this.job = "Instructor";
    this.sayHi = function() {
      return "Hello!"
    };
  }
}

export default PersonService;
```

The service will then need to be imported into our app module.

```js
// In app.js
import angular from 'angular';
import PersonService from './path/to/person.service';

angular.module("learnServices", [])
  .service('personService', PersonService);  // Note the capitalization
```

### *Factory* Service

An alternate way of writing a service is writing a **factory**. Using the factory, you pass in the name of your service and a callback function that returns an object.

```js
// person.factory.js
const personFactory = function() {
  return {
    name: "Matt",
    job: "Instructor",
    sayHi: function(){
      return "Hello!"
    }
  }
};

export default personFactory;
```

Each factory needs to be registered in the Angular module.

```js
// In app.js
import angular from 'angular';
import personFactory from './path/to/person.factory';

angular.module("learnServices", [])
  .factory('personFactory', personFactory);
```

## So which one??

In the past, factories were very popular, but nowadays, many ES6 style guides recommend creating services with the class system. Be aware of both of these and the differences between them and choose what feels better for you. Our examples will emphasize services.

### Exercise

Write down in your own words what is the difference between a factory service and a service service. After a minute, your instructor will cold call on a few students for the answer.

**NOTE:** A provider is the most complex method and is used less frequently. It is a factory that can be configured before the application starts, which allows for more flexibility, but for the applications we are going to build, you will not need this level of complexity.

## Creating our first Service

We are going to continue with our example from yesterday with our todo list. Let's suppose we want to keep a counter at the top of the page that manages the number of people in out todo list system. This part of our webpage is separate from our people list and todo list, so we will need to create a new controller for this piece of our webpage. We now have _two_ controllers that rely on the same information, people. In this case it's time to create the people service.

Create a file for the service in the `people` directory.

```shell
touch app/people/people.service.js
```

Inside the service, type the following code:

```js
class PeopleService {
  constructor() {
    this.people = [];
  }

  addPerson(personName) {
    this.people.push({ name: personName });
  }
}

export default PeopleService;
```

At first glance, it seems very similar to the People Controller we built yesterday. Now that the people information is stored in the people service, the People Controller needs to be changed. Let's import this service into our `app.js`.

```js
import angular from 'angular'

import PeopleCtrl from './people/people.controller';
import PeopleService from './people/people.service';

import TodoListCtrl from './todos/todolist.controller';

angular.module('todoApp', [])
  .service('PeopleService', PeopleService)
  .controller('PeopleCtrl', PeopleCtrl)
  .controller('TodoListCtrl', TodoListCtrl);
```

We have now given the service a name in the Angular module. Let's modify the People Controller to use this service. In `app/people/people.controller.js`

```js
class PeopleCtrl {
  constructor(peopleSvc) {
    this.peopleSvc = peopleSvc;
    this.nameToAdd = '';
  }

  addPerson(personName) {
    this.peopleSvc.addPerson(personName);
    this.nameToAdd = '';
  }

  people() {
    return this.peopleSvc.people;
  }
}

PeopleCtrl.$inject = ['PeopleService'];

export default PeopleCtrl;
```

Notice a few things:

* The constructor takes in an argument. This is the singleton that the service provides. We save that service in the instance with `this.peopleSvc = peopleSvc;`
* We used the service's `addPerson` method in the controller's `addPerson` method.
* We get access to the people with a `people()` method, which returns the people stored in the service.
* Lastly, we **inject** the PeopleService into the controller with `PeopleCtrl.$inject = ['PeopleService'];` This is how we can include the service into the constructor at the top. Note that the array contains a string with the name of the service. This is the same name as defined in the `app.js` file. This process is called **dependency injection**.

Create a new folder to represent the header of the page for these counters and initialize the controllers for the people counter.

```shell
mkdir app/header
touch app/header/people_count.controller.js
```


We are going to start off by creating a `service.js` file to define our service in. While we're at it, let's not forget to throw a script for it in our `index.html` file... `<script src="services.js"></script>`

Remember from above that one of the reasons we use services is seperation of concerns, so creating a new file for it makes sense.

```js
(function() {
  'use strict';

  const app = angular.module('todoApp');

  app.factory('personTodos', personTodos);

  function personTodos() {
    return {
      test: function() {
        console.log('winner winner vegan tofurkey dinner!');
      },
    }
  };

})();
```

Back in our controller, we inject this service like such:

```js
app.controller('TodoListCtrl', TodoListCtrl);

TodoListCtrl.$inject = ['$http', 'personTodos'];
// ----------------------------------^^^

// ------------------------------vvv
function TodoListCtrl($http, 'personTodos') {
  this.todoToAdd = '';
  this.todos = [];

  personTodos.test(); // üëàüèΩ

  this.addTodo = (person) => {
    return $http.post(`${server}/${person.id}/is-todos`, {
      completed: false,
      text: this.todoToAdd
    })
    .then((res) => {
      person.todos.push(res.data);
      this.todoToAdd = '';
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      throw err;
    });
  };
}
```

If you have everything wired up correctly, when you reload the page you should see your message in the console. üå±üêî <-- That's a vegetable turkey!

The `addTodo` method is making an http request to our API. That sounds prime for some.. re-factorying

![please clap](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0NwPo3VHujpJDI4w/giphy.gif)

Now that we know it's working let's replace that `test` method with an `addTodo` method. You can go ahead and just pull all the code from the `addTodo` method in your controller for this. We'll be changing just a couple things.
  * it will now also take the `todoText` as a second parameter.
  * at the top of our `services.js` file create a const pointing at the server url.
  * in the *then* we will get rid of the `push` to `res.data` and just return the response data instead.
  * inject `$http` into our service.


```js
(function() {
  'use strict';

  const app = angular.module('todoApp');
  const server = 'https://galvanize-todos.herokuapp.com/is-persons';

  app.factory('personTodos', personTodos);
  personTodos.$inject = ['$http'];

  function personTodos($http) {
    return {
      addTodo: (person, todoText) => {
        return $http.post(`${server}/${person.id}/is-todos`, {
          completed: false,
          text: todoText
        })
        .then((res) => {
          return res.data;
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          throw err;
        });
      },
    }
  };

})();
```

In our controller we will want to make a few changes as well.
  * our controller will no longer need `$http` injected into it.
  * we can swap out that `$http.post` request with a call to our factory
    method instead.
  * update our *then* push the `todo` and clear text in `todoToAdd`.

```js
function TodoListCtrl('personTodos') {
  this.todoToAdd = '';
  this.todos = [];

  this.addTodo = (person) => {
    personTodos.addTodo(person, this.todoToAdd)
      .then((todo) => {
        person.todos.push(todo);
        this.todoToAdd = '';
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        throw err;
      });
  };
}
```

Should be good to go. Let's test out adding a todo.

Moving on to the next controller, `PeopleCtrl`. The first thing we have
in there that can be refactored into our factory is the `addPerson`
funciton. We can start off by creating a new factory called `people` in
our `services.js` file.

```js
app.factory('people', people);

function people() {
  return {
    addPerson: () => {
      console.log('things and stuff');
    }
  }
}
```

We won't be needing `$http` in our controller anymore so let's swap that
out for our `people` factory.

```js
PeopleCtrl.$inject = ['people'] // people in $http out

function PeopleCtrl(peopleSvc) {
  this.nameToAdd = '';
  this.people = [];

  peopleSvc.addPerson() // should log out our stuffs!

  // more codez...
}
```

With that all wired up, we can move on to pulling the code from our
controllers `addPerson` and paste it into our factory.
  * inject `$http` into our factory.
  * provide a `name` parameter for our method.
  * we will want to return our `$http` request.
  * we can swap out `this.nameToAdd` with the one that gets passed in.
  * we will fully update our promise handler.
    * create a person constant set to `res.data`.
    * create a `todos` property on person set to an emptry array.
    * then return `person`.

```js
const server = 'https://galvanize-todos.herokuapp.com/is-persons';

app.factory('people', people);
people.$inject = ['$http'];

function people($http) {
  return {
    addPerson: (name) => {
      return $http.post(server, { name })
        .then((res) => {
          const person = res.data;
          person.todos = [];
          return person;
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          throw err;
        });
    }
  }
}
```

Annnnnd, back to the controller...
  * replace the `$http` request with our factory method.
  * pass the `nameToAdd` to our method.
  * update our `people` array with our new `person`.
  * clear the `nameToAdd` field.

```js
function PeopleCtrl(peopleSvc) {
  this.nameToAdd = '';
  this.people = [];

  this.addPerson = () => {
    peopleSvc.addPerson(this.nameToAdd)
      .then((person) => {
        this.people.push(person);
        this.nameToAdd = '';
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        throw err;
      });
  }
}
```

These next two `activate` functions are a bit heafty so we're just going to drop all the code
at once and walk through it together.

> `getPerson` method for `PersonCtrl`'s `activate` call.

```js
// services.js

function people($http)  {
  return {
    addPerson: (name) => {
      // codez...
    },
    getPerson: (id) => {
      let person;

      return $http.get(`${server}/${id}`)
        .then((res) => {
          person = res.data;

          return $http.get(`${server}/${id}/is-todos`);
        })
        .then((res) => {
          person.todos = res.data;
          return person;
        })
        .catch((err) => {
          throw err;
        });
    },
  }
}
```

```js
// controllers.js

PersonCtrl.$inject = ['$routeParams', 'people']; // no more $http, and added people

function PersonCtrl($routeParams, peopleSvc) {
    this.person = {};

    const { id } = $routeParams;

    const activate = () => {
      peopleSvc.getPerson(id).then((person) => {
        this.person = person;
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        throw err;
      });
    };

    activate();
  }
```

> `getAll` method for `PeopleCtrl`'s `activate` call.

```js
// services.js

people.$inject = ['$http', '$q']; // added the $q promise service

function people($http, $q) {
  return {
    getAll: function() {
      return $http.get(server).then((res) => {
        return $q.all(res.data.map((person) => {
          return $http.get(`${server}/${person.id}/is-todos`)
            .then((todos) => {
              person.todos = todos.data;
              return person;
            })
            .catch((err) => {
              throw err;
            });
        }));
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        throw err;
      });
    },
    addPerson: (name) => {
      // codez...
    },
    getPerson: (id) => {
      // codez...
    },
  }
}
```

```js
// controllers.js

function PeopleCtrl(peopleSvc) {
  this.nameToAdd = '';
  this.people = [];

  this.addPerson = () => {
    // codez...
  };

  const activate = () => {
    peopleSvc.getAll().then((peopleList) => {
      this.people = peopleList;
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      throw err;
    })
  };

  activate();
}
```
