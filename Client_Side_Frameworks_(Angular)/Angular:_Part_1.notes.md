### Workshops

**30-minute kick-off.**  The goal of this workshop is to:

- make sure students know which learning experience they are supposed to be working in, and can get access
- intro the topic briefly, show excitement about it, answer basic beginner questions
- talk about timelines, check entry tickets etc...

The entry ticket for these is successful completion of the previous learning experience.  Run these as many times as needed until students have all moved through it.

**Review**

Run a review workshop where you can cold-call, answer questions, pose problems to students.  Run as many of these as necessary until the class has gotten it.
