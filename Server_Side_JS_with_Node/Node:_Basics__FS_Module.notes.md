## THE MASTER COPY LIVES HERE: https://github.com/gSchool/node-curriculum/blob/master/unit-1/01-intro-to-nodejs.md

### Overview

- demo the fs module in a file and a repl
- talk about this repo and learn-to-learn stuff
- set students loose
- schedule time for one-on-one checkins
- schedule a time for review / drills

**Demo**

Just so students have some idea of what's happening, demo some `fs` stuff.  Ideally this will be a video, but until then, do it in person.

**Intro the repo**

There's a lot of text here.  To intro / kick off this learning experience:

First, model how to skim the document.  Point out that you see a bunch of links, and at the bottom you see some github repositories.  Then go back to the top and:

- have students read the setting the stage part aloud (one per line) and discuss.  In particular, the part about it taking some people longer than others should come up.  Discuss what to do when you are done early.
- model command-clicking on the links - especially that first one
- ask again how to watch youtube videos faster and set the expectation that they should actually watch all the videos (albeit in 40 minutes instead of the original time) and model opening up a text file and writing down questions and splitting windows into halves so you can watch on one half and answer questions in the other
- model going to the wikipedia page and skimming and then closing - the idea is not to fully grock every concept on that page and click every link
- model actually going doing "create an example that illustrates what an event binding is in the browser, do not use jQuery.‚Äù for realz and saving it in a file

Explain how submission works.  As they complete each objective, they can "Submit" it, which will trigger you to come around and look.

Explain that if they get 1s and 2s on any objectives, they're still responsible for learning the material, and they should talk to instructors about whether they should move on or repeat certain activities.
