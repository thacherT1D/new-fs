# Javsacript Error Handling

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should:

- Be able to throw and handle errors in Javascript.
- Be able to handle errors using callbacks and promises.
- Understand what a runtime error is.
- Understand what a developer error is.

# Introduction

Errors happen. No matter how great of code you write, how many validations you run input through, how many bugs you fix errors will happen.

It is important to be able to handle them *gracefully*; that is to say no matter what errors occur your program still continues as designed.

## Javascript

Javascript has built in functionality for handling errors.

Work through the following exercise on Github, it will cover the basics of built in Javascript error handling. Ensure you genuinely ponder and answer the questions provided. During the exercise you may find it useful to reference the resources below, to assist in answering the questions.
