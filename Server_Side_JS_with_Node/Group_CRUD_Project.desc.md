## Write a project proposal and get it approved by an instructor

For this project, you are _strongly encouraged_ to get into groups of 2-4 people. Together, you will need to come up with a product idea, and write it as a proposal that includes:

* A project description
    * Who uses it?
    * What outputs do they need?
    * What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?
* A list of technologies that you plan to use
* A well-defined and written-out feature list

There are some constraints around what technologies MUST be present in your app. Check out [Create and deploy a web app](#create-deploy) below.

Once you've put together your proposal, make a Pull Request as described for [this repository](https://github.com/gSchool/g19-projects)

### Example Ideas

* Library
* Movie Database
* Blog
* Retail Store
* Student Enrollment System
* Sports Performance Database
* Trip Itenerary

## Follow an Agile Development Workflow

Create a new pivotal project and invite your team members to it. You will need to split up your work and create stories for individual features and tasks.

## Create and deploy a complete CRUD app

Your web app should:

* CRUD
    * Allow users to create, read, update, and delete data from a form
    * Interact with a server-side
* HTML
    * Make good use of semantic HTML tags
    * Be well-indented, [validated](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), etc.

* CSS
    * Be well-designed
    * Use either SASS or a styling framework like Bootstrap
        * If you are using Bootstrap, please consider theming with something like bootswatch, customizing the download with SASS, or a [customizer](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/)
    * Be well-indented and clean
    * Use at least one web font
    * Split code into separate files where appropriate
    * Responsive design optional but strongly encouraged
* JavaScript
    * Well-indented, [linted](http://www.javascriptlint.com/online_lint.php), and use excellent variable names
    * Split code into separate files where appropriate
    * Optionally, use a test-driven development approach
* Workflow
    * Use wireframes to create your layouts before you build them
    * Use a feature-branch workflow for your user stories
    * Squash commits and issue pull requests rather merging directly to master

Your API should:

* API
    * Use express.js
    * Have routes for create, read, update, and delete operations on multiple routes
    * Be designed according to RESTful principles
    * CRUD data from/to a relational database using SQL or an ORM
* Auth
    * Support functionality for three role types:
        * A non-logged in user
        * A logged-in user with limited permissions
        * A logged-in superuser
    * Support login via a social network
    * Passwords should be hashed
    * Use signed Cookies
* Database
    * Use PostgreSQL
    * Be normalized to 3rd Normal Form
    * Be seeded with data
* Workflow
    * Use a feature-branch workflow for your user stories
    * Use an automated tool (such as Gulp) to build, deploy, and test your project
    * Document dependencies in a `package.json` file
    * Write well formatted and sensible commits; issue pull requests rather merging directly to master

## Complete a write-up of the project

* Describe what the project is, the technologies you used, and some information about the workflow you followed.
* 1-2 tight paragraphs

<a id="present"></a>

## Present your work to the class

* Be prepared to spend ~10 minutes presenting your work to the class.

This is a realistic approximation of what developing real products on a software team is like. You will have approximately 20-25 hours of class time to work on this. **It will not be enough time to do a good job on this project**. Plan on spending extra time outside of class, and coordinate this time with your team. This is another Big Deal Week, and you should put maximum effort into making it successful. You can and should use your teammates, classmates on other teams, and your instructors as learning resources, but this should be your own work.
