Standards Supported:

- Write higher order functions that accept functions as parameters
- Compare and contrast OOP and Functional Programming

Objectives:

- Define "side effects" in reference to functions
- Define mutable and immutable data. Discuss pros/cons.
- Use functional library to simplify data manipulation
- Create higher order functions for data manipulation
- Create functions that return promises

Topics: (overview of these)

- functional programming
- good function definition  (should be writing lots of functions)
- using lodash (or similar) to ease data manipulation





#Direction >>

- Read objectives.
- Have students watch the video (~10 mins)
- Have students read through the first section up to side effects.
- Give students 5 minutes on their own to research what "side effects" are in functional programming.
- Give students 2 minutes to discuss their findings with their table and then share an agreed upon answer with the class.

- Review what functional programming is with regards to side-effects.
