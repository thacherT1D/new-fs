1.  Have the students read up to "Dom Manipulation."

















- Questions (All using jQuery of course!):
    - How would you select something with the ID 'cat'?
    - How would you select everything with the class 'dog', and store it in a variable?
    - How can you create a DOM element of type 'div' with a class of 'monkey' in a single line?
    - How would I put a click event listener on every <p> element on a page?
