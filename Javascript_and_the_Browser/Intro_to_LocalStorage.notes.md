## Objectives

Leveraging the localStorage object means being able to persist, access, and manipulate data.

You should be able to:

- Discuss what types of values are useful to store in local storage
- Create items in localStorage that store data such as user settings.
- Retrieve items from localStorage and use that data to modify the behavior of something on the page.
- Remove items from localStorage.
- Stringify and parse objects to store larger datasets.
- Compare and contrast local storage with session storage

## Second Exercise: Background Preferences

Let's make a simple page that stores the users preference for a web page background color for each day of the week.  A user should be able to visit the site, enter a hex color for each day of the week, and the page's background color should reflect that input.  Furthermore, when the user closes the browser and revists the page, the background color should still be the same as the colors that were previously entered, and NOT the default blank color.
