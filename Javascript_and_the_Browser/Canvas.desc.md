It is great to introduce early in the class because it requires a lot of basic programming. The students can use canvas for their first client side projects to make games. It is also really cool because of how deep canvas is, you will find that some students take it really far.

Somebody rebuilt Starcraft in javascript and it is a great way to introduce students to the power of canvas and inspire them to build cool stuff.
