# Canvas
 canvas is an HTML element which can be used to draw graphics using JS. This can, for instance, be used to draw graphs, make photo composition or simple (and not so simple) animations. We can also use canvas to build games that have user interaction.

Canvas sizes can be defined using the HTML height and width property. In order to draw on the canvas we use a JavaScript context object, which creates graphics on the fly. We can use both 2d and 3d context.
