Also known as Usability Testing, User Testing is the technique of evaluating a product as a potential user. The Product Owner will observe the interaction and evaluate the choices made, along with any problems. The goal is to recognize roadblocks and facilitate user experience.

Because everyone can always use a fresh pair of eyes. Even more, you can get specific feedback from a real user experience.

## Objectives

* Design and execute user tests and then implement changes based on feedback.

### Real User Experience

The goal is to simulate a real user. The first step is to know who your target is. Think about who is going to be using your site. You may have multiple types of users as well and each type may use the site in a different way.

If you want to deep dive into this topic, read up about [User Personas](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-1/).

Once you find the user, paint a picture for them. Describe the product and their desire for using the product. You are setting up the scenario for the test.

For example, if your product is the website Etsy, explain that it's a creative marketplace for people to sell and buy crafts. Tell your user that he/she is an artist looking to sell their work.

### Real Case Scenario

Now, set a specific task, or tasks, for the user to test. For example, you might have a user test out the Photo Upload feature on Etsy.

You want to be specific and narrow with what you're testing but give few directions on how to accomplish it. As an observer, your goal is not to guide the user towards a particular answer but instead simply listen.

#### Tips

* Take notes.
* Encourage the user to vocalize their thought process.
* Distance yourself from the product.
* Don't react or interrupt.
* Don't draw attention to specific issues that you care about.
* Don't ask leading questions.

### Feedback

After the user has completed the task, get some feedback. Ask follow up questions:

* How easy or difficult was it for you to...?
* How did you know to...?
* Was there anything confusing about...?
* What would you suggest to make it more/less...?

### Next Steps

Repeat the process with 2-5 users to gather enough accurate data. If you're serious about user testing, develop your own greeting prompt or questionnaire. Again, the goal is to have a controlled environment and only to test your product, not the user.

### Lean Startup Methodology

The Lean process includes usability testing as part of their process.

"The Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and get a desired product to customers' hands faster."

User Testing is a crucial step in measuring the product. The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere.
