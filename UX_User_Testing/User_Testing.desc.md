## Objectives
Improve usability of a product by:

1. Testing a site as a real user
1. Gathering information about the experience
1. Analyze info and recommend changes

## What is it?

Also known as Usability Testing, it is the technique of evaluating a product as a potential user. The product owner will observe the interaction and evaluate the choices made, along with any problems. The goal is to recognize roadblocks and facilitate user experience.

## Why do it?

Because everyone can always use a fresh pair of eyes. Even more, you can get specific feedback from a real user experience.

### Real User Experience

The goal is to simulate a real user. The first step is to know who your target group is. Ask yourself: who is going to be using your product? Then, either: find that person or find somebody to be that person.

Once you find the user, paint a picture for them. Describe the product and their desire for using the product.

For example, if your product is the website etsy, explain that it's a creative marketplace for people to sell and buy crafts. Tell your user that he/she is an artist looking to sell their work.


### Real Case Scenario

Now, set a specific task, or tasks, for the user to test. Going with the example, tell the user to create an account on etsy, upload pictures of their work, set prices, and add descriptions.

Try to be specific with each task without explaining how to use the web app. The goal is to provide a controlled environment to evaluate specific tasks.

#### Tips

* Take notes
* Encourage the user to vocalize their thought process. 
* Distance yourself from the product.
* Don't react or interrupt.
* Don't draw attention to specific issues that you care about.
* Don't ask leading questions.

### Feedback

After the user has completed the task, get some feedback. Ask follow up questions: 

* How easy or difficult was it for you to… ?
* How did you know to… ?
* Was there anything confusing about… ?
* What would you suggest to make it less confusing?

### Next Steps

Repeat the process with 2-5 users to gather enough accurate data. If you're serious about user testing, develop your own greeting prompt or questionaire. Again, the goal is to have a controlled enviroment and only to test your product, not the user.

### Lean Startup Methodology

The Lean process includes usability testing as part of their process.

"The Lean Startup provides a scientific approach to creating and managing startups and get a desired product to customers' hands faster."

User Testing is a crucial step in meassuring the product. The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere.

### Exercise

* Find an app to test. One that you've built or currently working on.
* Find a user to test your app
* Explain the purpose of the app without showing it
* Explain a task(s) for the user to complete
* Provide your app and observe the user complete the task(s)
* Once the task is finished, collect Feedback. Talk to the user, ask follow up questions.
* Gain insight about your app and thank them for their time.
