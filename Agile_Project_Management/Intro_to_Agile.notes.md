## Objectives

* Distinguish agile from traditional project management
* Describe the scrum process
* Define the roles of product owner, Scrum Master, developer
* Define story, epic, velocity, backlog, and sprint
* Write a user story
* Size a user story
* Setup a project in Pivotal Tracker

## Hook

* Traditional project management looks like this:
    * Planned up front
    * All features are developed from the start
    * Tested at the end
    * Shipped to the customer
* What happens when...
    * You only get 80% of that done?
    * Something changes?
* What if you did this:
    * Planned the features that you were working on now
    * Built and tested them
    * Shipped them to the customer frequently
* What happens when...
    * You only get 80% of that done?
    * Something changes?

## Agile Theory

### The Agile Manifesto

```
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
```

### The 12 Principles

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Highest priority is NOT planning, documenting, or coding

> Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

Agile is an "anti-fragile" process

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Tight feedback loops

> Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

Customers, marketers, and executives are your partners, not your enemies

> Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

Developers are more like doctors than they are line-workers

> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

* Not email or IMs
* Not "the only" way, just the most efficient and effective

> Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Not "percent done", meetings had, or decisions made

> Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

* "Crunch time" creates burnout
* People usually don't recover from burnout
* When they leave, they take their knowledge, ideas, and experience

> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Modular software architecture and good coding practices allow us to change our minds and add features without adding rework

> Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

* YAGNI - "You ain't gonna need it"
* A lot of scope creep happens inside the project team

> The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

Not command-and-control teams

> At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

Kaizen - "Continuous improvement"

## Exercise: Waterfall & Agile

Describe a waterfall project that you worked on. What would have been different if it were run as an agile project? (10 Minutes)

Notes:

* If you weren't aware of the planning process being used, it was probably waterfall and you were probably only executing one level of the waterfall
* Did you have to follow a lot of broken processes?
* Did you feel any incentive to fix them?
* Did you feel any ownership of the work?
* Did you communicate with people before or after you in the process?

## Scrum

### Overview

* A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.
* During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.
* The team has a certain amount of time — a sprint (usually two to four weeks) — to complete its work, but it meets each day to assess its progress (daily Scrum).
* Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal.
* At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.
* The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
* As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.

### Scrum Roles

* Product Owner
* Scrum Master 
* Dev Team

### Scrum Terms

At a minimum, make sure these are covered:

* Backlog
* Story
* Epic
* Sprint
* Velocity

### User Story Formats

* (role) can (action)
* As a (role) I want (something) so that (benefit)

### Story Sizing

* Fibonacci
* Small, Medium, Large
* Small, needs to be split

## Exercise: Stories

* In groups, write stories for a forum, email client, or search engine (15 minutes)
    * Look for good story format
    * User's language- nothing technical
* Prioritize these features
    * One person acts as product owner
    * Asks for the teams' feedback on prioritizing, but makes the decisions
    * _Why_ is something higher priority?
* As the dev team, size them using planning poker (15 minutes)
    * One person acts as Scrum Master, doesn't vote
    * Prioritize from top to bottom
    * Low / High numbers have to defend
    * Drive consensus

## Agile Project Management Software

* [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com)

## Exercise: Pivotal Tracker

* Take the stories from your group and enter them into a project on your Pivotal Tracker account (30 minutes, on own)
    * Instructors can make Tracker accounts for the whole class in the cohort view of the LMS with `Setup` -> `Tracker Accounts`
    * Students access their tracker accounts by resetting their passwords
