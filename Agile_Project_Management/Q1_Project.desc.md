The goal of this project is to demonstrate your mastery of the concepts covered over the past quarter. Like your capstone, you're expected to come up with a project idea and implement it all on your own. Unlike a PhD dissertation, you are _not_ expected to discover and publish an idea that's never been done before. Asking your classmates and instructors for help throughout the process is strongly encouraged, but your work must be your own.

During project week, you'll have approximately 24 hours of class time to implement your idea. It'll most likely not be enough time, so plan on allocating extra time for it outside of class. On the last day of project week, you'll give short demonstration of your project to the class.

## Initial Deliverables

 - Two Project Proposals (see below).
 - Wireframing and User Stories of approved project.
 - Project Write up.

For this project, you'll submit two proposals to an instructor for approval. The goal of the approval process is to give you the tools to finish one of your ideas in a week. You'll be given class time to work on your proposals, but you'll probably have to work on them outside of class too.

The best way to come up with a viable project idea is to do some light experimentation with a web API or technology that interests you. Take a weather service API, for example. Try sending requests to the API and see what kind of data you get back in response. In this case, it's likely to include a weather forecast for the day.

Once you figure out how the API works and see how the data actually looks, start thinking about the problems you could solve with this knowledge. Using our weather service API example from before, one problem worth solving could be knowing whether or not it's a good day to bring an umbrella to school. That's a problem that you and your fellow students might like solved.

Once you have a solvable problem and an audience who'd like it solved, you have the seeds of viable project idea. Next, take those seeds and plant them in a project proposal. For each proposal, please answer the following questions.

- What problem does your project solve?
- Who has this problem?
- How will your project solve this problem?
- What inputs does it need?
- What outputs does it produce?
- What web APIs will it use?
- What technologies will it use?
- What additional features will it have?

Remember, you're _not_ expected to discover and publish a brand new idea so keep your project ideas simple. And you _must_ submit your proposals to an instructor for approval before you start translating one of your ideas into code.

## Complete a write-up of the project

At the top of this file, please write a few paragraphs that answer the above questions.


## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for your project are as follows.

- Have [valid](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), well-indented, and semantic HTML.
- Have [valid](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), well-indented, and minimally-specific CSS.
- Have [linted](http://eslint.org/), readable, and concise JavaScript.
- Use a front-end framework like Semantic UI, Bootstrap, Foundation, or Materialize.
- Respond to form input and/or user events.
- Connect to at least one external web API via Ajax.
- Be deployed to a production environment.

### Bonuses

- Customize the color palette or theme of your front-end framework.
- Use a unique javascript library.
- Optimize for various viewport sizes using responsive design.
- Develop a game instead of an application.
- Or connect to external hardware like an Arduino or MIDI keyboard.

## Demonstrate your project to the class

At the end of project week, you'll give a brief, 5-minute demonstration of your project for the class. Your audience will want to hear you answer the following questions.

- What's the name of your project?
- What problem does it solve/ What did you set out to accomplish?
- How does your project solve the problem, or accomplish the task?
- What web APIs did it use?
- What technologies did it use?
- What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?

## Submit your project for assessment

Find the corresponding exercise in the learning management system and submit a link to your project's GitHub repository. Make sure you include a link to your deployed application at the top of the this page.

Or browse the [ProgrammableWeb's API repository](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory). You'll want to avoid calling web API endpoints that require [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) for authorization, a technique you'll study later in this course.

### JavaScript libraries

Pick a JS library. Check out some of the suggestions below, but feel free to pick your own. Just make sure to talk to Oli or myself first.

 - Canvas
 - Raphael
 - web audio api
 - sound.js
 - buzz
 - Leaflet
 - Google Maps
 - Velocity JS
 - Move JS
 - Firebase
 - Famous JS
 - Paper.js


## Pay attention to your mindset

Even with the best of intentions and preparation, things won't go as planned and that's okay. There are always unforeseen challenges that arise during project week regardless of how successful you've been in the past. How you react to this will determine whether you're sprinting or limping across the finish line.

The number one thing that affects a student's performance during project week is losing confidence in oneself. Remember, web development is hard and it's still fairly new to you. If you're feeling down on yourself, consider one of these alternate ways of thinking.
