The goal of this project is to demonstrate your mastery of the concepts covered over the past quarter. Like your capstone, you're expected to come up with a project idea and implement it all on your own. Unlike a PhD dissertation, you are _not_ expected to discover and publish an idea that's never been done before. Asking your classmates and instructors for help throughout the process is strongly encouraged, but your work must be your own.

During project week, you'll have approximately 24 hours of class time to implement your idea. It'll most likely not be enough time, so plan on allocating extra time for it outside of class. On the last day of project week, you'll give short demonstration of your project to the class.

Or browse the [ProgrammableWeb's API repository](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory). You'll want to avoid calling web API endpoints that require [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) for authorization, a technique you'll study later in this course.

## Submit a project proposal for approval

For this project, you'll submit a proposal to an instructor for approval. The goal of the approval process is to give you the tools to finish your idea in a week. You'll be given class time to work on your proposal, but you'll probably have to work on it outside of class too.

The best way to come up with a viable project idea is to do some light experimentation with a web API or technology that interests you. Take a weather service API, for example. Try sending requests to the API and see what kind of data you get back in response. In this case, it's likely to include a weather forecast for the day.

Once you figure out how the API works and see how the data actually looks, start thinking about the problems you could solve with this knowledge. Using our weather service API example from before, one problem worth solving could be knowing whether or not it's a good day to bring an umbrella to school. That's a problem that you and your fellow students might like solved.

Once you have a solvable problem and an audience who'd like it solved, you have the seeds of viable project idea. Next, take those seeds and plant them in a project proposal. For your proposal, please answer the following questions.

- What problem does your project solve?
- Who has this problem?
- How will your project solve this problem?
- What inputs does it need?
- What outputs does it produce?
- What web APIs will it use?
- What technologies will it use?
- What additional features will it have?

Additionally, please include a pencil and paper wireframe with your answers. Included in this repository is a [template](https://students-gschool-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/190/template.pdf) wireframe that can be printed out on 11Ã—17 inch paper. Here's an example of how a past student used this template.

Remember, you're _not_ expected to discover and publish a brand new idea so keep your project idea simple. And you _must_ submit your proposal to an instructor for approval before you start translating one of your ideas into code.

## Create and deploy a complete CRUD app

Your web app should:

* CRUD
    * Allow users to create, read, update, and delete data from a form
    * Interact with a server-side A
* HTML
    * Make good use of semantic HTML tags
    * Be well-indented, [validated](https://validator.w3.org/nu/), etc.

* CSS
    * Be well-designed
    * Use either SASS or a styling framework like Bootstrap
        * If you are using Bootstrap, please consider theming with something like bootswatch, customizing the download with SASS, or a [customizer](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/)
    * Be well-indented and clean
    * Use at least one web font
    * Split code into separate files where appropriate
    * Responsive design optional but strongly encouraged
* JavaScript
    * Well-indented, [linted](http://www.javascriptlint.com/online_lint.php), and use excellent variable names
    * Split code into separate files where appropriate
    * Optionally, use a test-driven development approach
* Workflow
    * Use wireframes to create your layouts before you build them
    * Use a feature-branch workflow for your user stories
    * Squash commits and issue pull requests rather merging directly to master

Your API should:

* API
    * Must have atleast 2 API integrations
    * Use express.js
    * Have routes for create, read, update, and delete operations on multiple routes
    * Be designed according to RESTful principles
    * CRUD data from/to a relational database using SQL or an ORM
* Auth
    * Support functionality for three role types:
        * A non-logged in user
        * A logged-in user with limited permissions
        * A logged-in superuser
    * Support login via a social network
    * Passwords should be hashed
    * Use signed Cookies
* Database
    * Use PostgreSQL
    * Be seeded with data
    * Have a separate user for the application
* Workflow
    * Use a feature-branch workflow for your user stories
    * Document dependencies in a `package.json` file
    * Squash commits and issue pull requests rather merging directly to master

## Make a video highlighting the functionality of your app

* Make a 3-6 minute video explaining your project and demonstrating its features

## Complete a write-up of the project

* Describe what the project is, the technologies you used, and some information about the workflow you followed.
* 1-2 tight paragraphs

## Add all three of these to an online portfolio

* Create a portfolio on the [student portal](http://students.galvanize.com)
* Link to your final deployed site, your video, your respositories, and your write-up
* This will be added to your web development portfolio

## Present your work to the class

* Be prepared to spend ~10 minutes presenting your work to the class.
