## Process

- From 9am-5pm, please pair full-time (if possible in your group)
- Use Pivotal Tracker to track stories
- Other group members must accept your stories (you can't accept your own)
- Value the process over the product :) Aim for fair contribution, even if it means not shipping a feature or two
- Pair with everyone on the team

## Requirements

Your group must build an app that has:

- mongo
- server-side javascript
- client-side javascript
- custom CSS (if you use a framework, there needs to be some significant custom CSS in addition)
- at least 2 API integrations
