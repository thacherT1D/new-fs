# Week 11 Project

* Do stories the friday before week 11 and get everything set up
* Have a reason for students to be present at the beginning and end of each day:
    * Group warmups or a brief lecture in the morning
    * Acceptance tests at the end of the day
* This project is CRUCIAL for career success
* Their projects/writeups/videos will go in the LMS
* Emphasize that classtime is not enough to do a good job on this project
* A class of 30 doing 5-minute presentations will take 2.5 hours. If you add in time for breaks and feedback, presentations will probably take all of Friday afternoon.
