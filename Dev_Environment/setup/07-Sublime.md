### Sublime Text 3 (subl alias) / Package Manager

**What is it? What will I be using it for?**

Sublime Text is going to be our editor of choice. If you are more comfortable with other text editors like Atom or Textmate you may use them but we **STRONGLY** urge you to consider using Sublime Text 3 (it's really nice).

**I have Sublime Text 2....that works right?**

Unfortunately not :( - although it is still in beta, Sublime Text 3 has a set of packages (we'll discuss later what those are) which are incredibly useful and are not available in Sublime Text 2. If you already have Sublime Text 2, please delete it and install Sublime Text 3.

**How do I install it?**

**Using the subl alias**

It would be really nice if we could open up sublime from the terminal. To get started with that read this (we will go through this process together):

**NEXT STEPS**

While Sublime Text 3 comes with some nice things out of the box, there are a bunch of additional tools we want to add to our text editor (we will call those "packages"). In order to do that, we need a tool to help us install these "packages" (we call that a "package manager"). Head over to https://packagecontrol.io/installation and follow the instructions for Sublime Text 3. If you install this correctly, you should be able to type `command+shift+p` in sublime and type in `install package` and see something.
