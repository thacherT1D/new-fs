There are 3 repos here, they were created to help students go through a full stack app and find errors! The point is for them to read the errors and navigate through these apps and find bugs of all sorts!

Great exercise to give once they're fully deploying and building full stack apps, but getting errors left and right! 

* [repo one](https://github.com/gSchool/books-bugs)
* [repo two](https://github.com/gSchool/helpdesk)
* [repo three](https://github.com/gSchool/Artist-bugs)

The first two have bugs in branches, so git checkout bugs-1 / bugs-2 / bugs-3 
The third one has bugs in branches: bugs-1, bugs-2, bugs-4, bugs-5
*bugs-5 is a doozy! Stretch goal!
