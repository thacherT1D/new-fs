#Some full stack apps created with bugs for you to go through and debug! 


* [repo one](https://github.com/gSchool/books-bugs)
* [repo two](https://github.com/gSchool/helpdesk)
* [repo three](https://github.com/gSchool/Artist-bugs)

All have branches with bugs, so git checkout bugs-1 .....bugs-2, bugs-3. The third repo has bugs on braches: bugs-1, bugs-2, bugs-4, bugs-5
