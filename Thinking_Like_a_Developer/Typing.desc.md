# Objectives

By the end of this lesson students should:

- Explain why the importance of being able to competently touch type.
- Work towards being able to code at 40WPM or more.

# Touch Typing

A developer spends a great deal of time on a keyboard. For both productivity and health reasons, it is an important skill to master. Here are just a few arguments:

- The less you have to think about typing the more you can focus on the task at hand.
- Just like a musician missing a note, mistyping a word can significantly throw off your focus.
- Repetitive stress injuries and carpal tunnel are very real. Typing with proper form and posture can go a long way to avoiding any typing related health issues.

**You Do:** Read up on good form while touch typing [here](http://www.ratatype.com/learn/).

The website also provides a typing tutor for training muscle memory. Practice daily if you find yourself needing to:
- looking at the keys
- mistyping keys
- typing slowly

Our goal is to have you typing code at 40 words per minute or more. Here are some websites that you can use to continuously practice your touch typing skills:

- [Typing.io](https://typing.io/) is a great resource to practice typing code.
- [Type Racer](http://play.typeracer.com/) is a fun game that pits you against others to see who can type faster.
- [Z-Type](http://phoboslab.org/ztype/) is a typing game styled as a space shooter.
