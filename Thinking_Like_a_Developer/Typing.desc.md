# Objectives

By the end of this lesson students should:

- Explain why it is important to be able to touch type.
- Work towards being able to code at 40WPM or more.

# Touch Typing

A developer spends a great deal of time on a keyboard. It is important to be proficient for both productivity and health reasons.

- The less you have to think about typing the more you can focus on code.
- Just like a musician missing a note, mistyping a word can significantly throw off your focus.
- Repetitive stress injuries and carpal tunnel are very real. Typing with proper form and posture can go a long way to avoiding any typing related health issues.

Read up on good form while touch typing [here](http://www.ratatype.com/learn/). If you find yourself needing to look at the keys, struggling to remain accurate and quick the website also provides a typing tutor for training muscle memory and a typing test to promote speed.

Our goal is to have you typing code at 40 words per minute or more. Here are some websites that you can use to continuously practice your touch typing skills:

- [Typing.io](https://typing.io/)
- [Type Racer](http://play.typeracer.com/)
- [Z-Type](http://phoboslab.org/ztype/)
