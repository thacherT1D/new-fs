## Workspace

It is very important to have a consistent and well organized workspace. Ultimately, how you arrange and organize your projects is up to you.  

For example you could organize your folders by quarter:

- workspace
  - q1
    - notes
    - warmups
    - projects
  - q2
    - ...
  - q3
    - ...
  - q4
    - ...

Alternatively, instead of by quarter you could organize by week:

- workspace
  - week1
    - notes
    - warmups
    - projects
  - week2
    - ...
  - week3
    - ...
  - ...

For now, you just need to create the top level folder to keep all of your notes, warmups and class projects.

In Terminal, run:

```bash
mkdir ~/workspace
```
