# Slack

We use slack for all formal communication. It is highly recommended that you use the desktop app instead of just using the web app.

## Why?

When it's an app you can switch to it with COMMAND+TAB.  When it's open in a browser, it takes longer to get to it and also read documentation / preview your local development apps etc...

NOTE: you can also download the mobile app.
