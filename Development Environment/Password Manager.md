# Password Managers

If you don't currently use a password manager, now is a great time to invest in one. As a professional web developer, you're going to be responsible for hundreds, if not thousands, of passwords throughout your career.

There are many password managers on the market.  Some popular ones are:

## 1Password

[1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)'s user-friendly interface makes it easy to generate and access all your account credentials on all your devices. More importantly, you can trust the company behind 1Password to employ the best security practices available.

While it's not a free application, there is a 30-day free trial. And if you become a satisfied customer, you can use the `MacPowerUsers` coupon code to take 20% off the price.
