# Window Managers

## Objectives

By the end of this article you should be able to:

- Make a window full-width and full-height (but not fullscreen) without using a mouse
- Make a window cover the left or right half of your screen without using a mouse
- Make a window centered on your screen without using a mouse

## Why is this important?

Developers **don't swipe through screens** and **don't make apps full screen** very often.  

There's an important difference between **full height / full width** and **fullscreen**.  When you are in _fullscreen_ mode, you need to swipe with 3 fingers to change out, and keyboard shortcuts like COMMAND TAB don't always work the way you might expect.

There are times when you'll want to focus on a task and make a window full-width and full-height.  There are times that you'll want to split your screen (see two windows at the same time).  You'll also _always_ be switching apps with COMMAND+TAB and COMMAND+TILDE.  Using a window manager makes this seamless.

You may be surprised to learn that there are no universal keyboard shortcuts to quickly and neatly arrange application windows on the screen. For this, you'll need a tool called a window manager. There are many window managers on the market

You _must_ install and configure a window manager.  You may choose which one looks the best to you.
