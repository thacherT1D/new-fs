    - wasting these precious resources on distractions that aren’t related to the
    task at hand handicaps learning. Focused practice is the key to developing a new
    skill.\r\n\n\n\n\nLearn Anything (motivation) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC82Il2cjqA\r\nShort

    the stage\r\n  *Students have apps in full-screen mode and aren’t trying to move
    windows around all the time.\r\n  * When observing a student, you don’t see any
    notifications pop up\r\n  * When students alt+tab through applications, the only
    apps that are open are the ones that they need at the current time.\r\n  * Student
    uses a todo list and calendar to remember tasks and appointments (aren’t trying
    to hold them in their working memory)\r\n* Clarify the “what” and the “why”\r\n
    \ * If you ask a student what they’re currently working on, they phrase it in
    terms of a specific outcome they’re working towards. (NOT: “I’m learning Javascript!”
    YES: “I’m working on being able to describe the javascript object model.”)\r\n
    \ * Student is able to explain why what they’re working on is important/meaningful
    (the ‘why’) and how it relates to the big picture.\r\n* Prioritize Process over
    Product\r\n  * ‘Winning’ for students is time on task/focused practice. They spend
    LOTS of time practicing what’s in their zone of proximal development. (** this
    is arguably the MOST IMPORTANT ‘lead measure’ for student success in the long-run
    **)\r\n  * Students don’t beat themselves up if they don’t complete a project
    or reach the same heights as other students. \r\n  * Student doesn’t take shortcuts
    or cheat to finish the product at the expense of deep learning.\r\n  * Students
    time-box their work, separating planning from doing. They choose a task, and then
    work on it for a specified amount of time without getting distracted.\r\n"

    strive for fluency! They work the knowledge/skill/process into their long-term
    memory through lots of practice and exposure.\r\n  * Student activity seeks out
    external resources/practice (not just relying on proprietary Galvanize resources)\r\n*
    Takes Risks (Growth Mindset)\r\n  * Student does not hide weaknesses from instructors
    or other students. \r\n  * Student eagerly engages in difficult tasks. Not afraid
    to take on assignments projects that seem insurmountable.\r\n* Has fun\r\n  *
    Smiles!\r\n  * When student finds themselves in ‘fight or flight’ mode, they take
    steps to return to a joyful/relaxed state (deep breaths, walk, stretch, play a
    game, change the activity/context, refocus on the ‘why’)\r\n"

    you can do as a student. We want students to become their own teachers and have

    are sockets?\r\n- when might you want to use sockets? \r\n- what are the advantages
    of sockets?\r\n- What’s the difference between sockets and HTTP?\r\n- What are
    some common socket libraries / products?  Socket.io / Pusher / Firebase\r\n\r\nVocab\r\n\r\n-
    Realtime web\r\n- Server-side push\r\n- Polling\r\n- Persistent connection\r\n-
    Analogies like “phone call” vs “email”\r\n- Stateful protocol\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nWe
    don’t have to hold them to the standard of building sockets themselves.  This
    is the horizontal part of the T-shaped individual.\r\n\r\nStudents can/will choose
