# Q3 - Data Structures, Algorithms and Object-Oriented Programming

A huge part of this quarter will be spent just writing code and more code and moar code.

The overall path looks like this:

1. Programming fundamentals review
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 1
  - LinkedLists
  - Stacks and Queues
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 1
  - Basic state and behavior
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 2
  - Higher order functions
  - Recursion
  - Binary Trees
  - Trees
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 2
  - More complicated state / behavior
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 3
  - Binary search
  - Sorting algorithms
1. Data Structures / Algorithms 4
  - Graphs
  - Tries
  - Hash Tables

## 3 Parts to the exercises

There are 3 parts to the path:

**â˜… Required Activities**

Required activities are indicated by a â˜….  These are the activities that everyone should do.  

**Further Practice**

At times we provide alternate exercises for further practice if you want other opportunities to develop automaticity and fluency.

**Stretch**

These are generally pretty hard.  Only do them if you pretty much crushed the other stuff, and feel like you can still cover the material coming up in time.

## ðŸ•— Timing

Where applicable you'll see a ðŸ•— to indicate that there's a expectation of time involved.  This happens mostly in the earlier parts of the path, where you are building fundamental skills that you will need to build on in future exercises.

If you didn't finish it within that timeframe on your first try, **burn it down** and do it again.  If there's a time icon, it means that this is something you should be fluent in.  Solving them should be **automatic**.
