Promises are hard.  Push the students to really grok these - it's OK if it takes a week or two - it's worth it.  

These exercises are designed to be harder than most of the promise code they'll write on a daily basis in most app development shops.  But when it's time to pull out the complex promise code, they'll be prepared!

Plan on multiple small group workshops.
