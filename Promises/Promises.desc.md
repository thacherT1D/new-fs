  We are currently transitioning this Learning Experience from Mongo to SQL.  Even though these reference Mongo, we recommend using SQL.

I _promise_ you this will be an awesome unit (yuk! yuk!)

Promises show up pretty much everywhere in JavaScript these days.  Having total mastery over promises will allow you to write clean and beautiful, well-factored asynchronous code.

These exercises predominantly use Monk to demonstrate promises because it's so lightweight / quick and easy.  But the exact same principles and techniques would apply if you were reading files, making API calls or making any other async calls that return promises.

## Chained / Nested Promises

When you get to the part about chained promises, you may want to watch the following video several times as you learn more about promises:

ERRATA: there's an error at 3:55 - the bottom function box should read "f2"

## Promise.all

When you get to the part about `Promise.all`, definitely watch this video to get a visual sense of what's happening.

## Exercises

Go through the following repositories in order:

- Promises: https://github.com/gSchool/javascript-promises-with-monk
- [Modeling Data](https://github.com/gSchool/modeling-data)
- Nested Callbacks: https://github.com/gSchool/asynchronous-js-nested-callbacks
- Mongo Associations w/ References: https://github.com/gSchool/mongo-associations
- Associated Objects https://github.com/gSchool/express-mongo-associated-objects

## Final Project

The summative assessment for this is 

https://github.com/gSchool/express-mongo-associations-assessment

The idea is that you both demonstrate your skills in promises / mongo associations / express CRUD, and _also_ build a project that you can use in your portfolio!

If you can't come up with a good project idea don't fret!  We can help :)
