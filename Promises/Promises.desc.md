I _promise_ you this will be an awesome unit (yuk! yuk!)

Promises show up pretty much everywhere in JavaScript these days.  Having total mastery over promises will allow you to write clean and beautiful, well-factored asynchronous code.

These exercises predominantly use knex to demonstrate promises because it's so lightweight / quick and easy.  But the exact same principles and techniques would apply if you were reading files, making API calls or making any other async calls that return promises.
