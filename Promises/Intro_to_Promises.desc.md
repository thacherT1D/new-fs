## Async

Before jumping into promises, it is very important to understand the asynchronous nature of JavaScript. Imagine if your application had to wait for one event to finish before it could start another. What kind of problems could that lead to? What would the user experience be like?

First, watch the video at https://vimeo.com/134061121 - password is schoolhouserock

Now read throught he MDN docs at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop

This is a great video as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ

And here is a link to the excellent tool he built for visualizing the event loop. Play around with it a little and watch how your code is executed: latentflip.com

##Promises

Promises show up pretty much everywhere in JavaScript these days, including interviews.  Having total mastery over promises will allow you to write clean and beautiful, well-factored asynchronous code.

These exercises predominantly use Monk to demonstrate promises because it's so lightweight / quick and easy.  But the exact same principles and techniques would apply if you were reading files, making API calls or making any other async calls that return promises.

## Chained / Nested Promises

When you get to the part about chained promises, you may want to watch the following video several times as you learn more about promises:

ERRATA: there's an error at 3:55 - the bottom function box should read "f2"

## Promise.all

When you get to the part about `Promise.all`, definitely watch this video to get a visual sense of what's happening.
