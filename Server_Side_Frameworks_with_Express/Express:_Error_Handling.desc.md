Have students clone the repo, ask them not to go too far ahead.

Lecture in 4 parts:

1. basic JS try/catch/finally and the concept of throwing strings and errors
1. the 2 additional types of node errors: Node-style callbacks and ErrorEvents
1. Promises, rejections and errors in the `then` functions
1. Errors in express w/ the `next` function

In each part, have students do the exercises with you.  Lots of mini I-do / We-do / You-do interactions there.
