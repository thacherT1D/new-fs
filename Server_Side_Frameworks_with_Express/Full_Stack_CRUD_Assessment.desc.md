## g18 Notes
In g18 we gave them this one hour timed assessment. The assessment had the front end already built, all the students had to do was build their routes, wire it up with a database and deploy! They could use any resources except notes and previous/other assignments! 

___We had them screencast for the full hour!___

* We split up the videos between us four instructors and gave ourselves about a week to watch through them, most can be watched in double time or faster - depends on the student

####What we were looking for
* Do you know your routes? 
* Can you wire up to a database and get your app working with it 
* Can you deploy ?
* Workflow! 
    * Reading all the stories first 
    * Commit frequency, push and deploy 
    * Branching/merging VS pushing to master 
* Debugging / googling 
    * Were you reading your error messages 
    * Are you console.logging correctly 
    * Are you able to let go of your code are you attached to it 
    * Are you using proper terms when googling? 
    * Are you just copying and pasting what you may find into your work or testing it first? 
    * Can you figure out what's going wrong and actively try to fix it 

####What we saw... 
* Students were not reading through the entire document first! Just tackling story by story 
* Commit frequency was EXTREMELY LOW! They either never commit or had about 3-4 commits on the entire assessment 
* Some students would open up their previous assignments and straight try to copy! They may have thought that we weren't actually going to watch these screencasts! Some opened multiple previous assignments 
* Some students took longer than an hour and disregarded the that was up 
* Others had forgotten about npm installs and tweeking their app.js 
* One student ALMOST went and looked at other students work through github pull requests 
* When stuck, they wouldn't take the time to work through pinpointing the problem, or reading their nodemon errrors 
* Some would make changes but never refresh the browser! So they would think their changes were wrong 
* Some never even looked at the browser to see if what they were coding was working! 
* A lot of students would get stuck and go straight to their previous assignments instead of googling for answers

___It was horrific!___ 

####On the other side...
* Students were creating branches per story, then merging! 
* Students would commit/push after each story completion
* students were going to express docs, stack overflow, pg docs! 
* Students console.log like every line to pin point where the problem was 
* Students were deploying after each story 
* Students were willing to burn down the entire route and start fresh * student would check to make sure nodemon was still running before even going to the browser and find out 
* Students were reading through the full documentation first 

___It was amazing!___ 

####The one on ones.. 
After going through the assessments we were able to do one on ones with the students and talk to them about what we saw and what concerns/compliments we had for them! This was awesome because we could even show them their video of when they do specific things that we were concerned about! Them seeing the problems we had pointed out was extremely beneficial to them as well! Lots of 'oh shit I didn't even realize I do that' or 'Wow that would have helped me a ton' 

For the students that copied work over from previous assignments, they didn't understand that turning a blank or partially completed assessment with an hour video of them googling and trying to get the correct code on their own through online resources is MUCH better and allows us instructors to understand where they're at knowledge wise so much better than them just copying over code! Copying code tells us nothing about your progress! 

___Overall an EXTREMELY beneficial method of assessing!___
