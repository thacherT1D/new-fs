## THE MASTER COPY IS HERE: https://github.com/gSchool/node-curriculum/blob/master/unit-2/intro-express.md

The main idea here is to drive home the point that you solve interesting problems using algorithms, and package them for the web.

The other main idea is to get them a ton of practice creating and pushing express apps and repos to GitHub to keep their streaks up.

**Intro Workshop**

Hold multiple of them - only kick things off for people who are ready.  

- Talk about how to watch the videos, how to go to the git repo.
- How in this one you don't have to fork and clone - you should create your own repos and push them.

**Review Workshop**

Coming soon... links to other workshops you can run that are purely Express-based, but basically building any kind of form that processes data little, and has multiple routes is a good workshop topic.
