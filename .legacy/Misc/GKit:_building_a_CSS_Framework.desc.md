# CSS Review - building a framework

#### Objectives:

Students will able to...

- 1 of 3: explain what a CSS framework is in one sentence
- 2 of 3: understand the benefits of using a grid for layouts
- 3 of 3: develop their own default style sheets.

## 1 of 3: What is a CSS framework?

A CSS Framework is a collection of utilities that allow for:

  - rapid and simplified development
  - consistent and standardized design

Frameworks accomplish this by packaging a lot of items that developers commonly need. Some of examples of these items would be:

  - A reset or normalized style sheet.
    - This way everything appears consistent across multiple browsers.
  - A responsive grid.
    - This allows for rapid layout design that works on many screen sizes
  - Typography - a collection of preset styles regarding fonts
    - Generally includes presets for h1-h6
    - Often times includes alignment for text such as centering & justification
  - Iconography - a collection of icons.
  - Element Styling - standardized aesthetic for common elements
    - Forms, tables, lists, images buttons and more!
    - Usually has multiple styles for each of these items.
  - Other helper classes
    - Block positioning, clears and other utilities
  - Custom components - pre-made components
    - Headers, nav bars, modal windows, panels, cards, tooltips etc...

#### You do:

    1. Write down three styles that you use often
    1. Would you these be something that would be useful in a CSS framework?

## 2 of 3: What is a grid?

  A grid is a tool to build complex responsive layouts in a simple and fast fashion.

  - Grids use rows and columns to build layouts.
  - Grids can help enable responsive design by allowing components to be horizontal on some screen sizes, and vertical on others.

  Let's code up an example!

## 3 of 3: Let's build a framework!

Today we are building a CSS framework with some preset components. Open up [GKit](https://github.com/gSchool/gkit-review-css-by-creating-a-framework) and get coding.

## Conclusion

We learned about reference types. Combined with our knowledge of primitive types, we now know all the data types used in JavaScript. Awesome!
