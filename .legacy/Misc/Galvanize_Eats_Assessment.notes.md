* This is intended to be a Q1 assessment, and a companion to the personal front-end project. It accurately represents authentic junior developer tasks. It uses:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * DOM Manipulation
    * Arrays & Objects
    * Sorting
    * Calculations
    * GET and POST API calls
    * Forms
    * Events
    * Validation
    * Agile
    * Git
    * Deployment
* You have to add your cohort group to the assessment repo before they can see it
* A potential solution is in this [private repo](https://github.com/gSchool/galvanize-eats-solution.git)
* Original intention is to limit them to a day. Need to test out how long it actually takes
* Also my intention to replace the screenshots with wireframes, just need to make them
* Might be cool to have the POST endpoint return something
* API is hosted on Heroku under "galvanize-eats-api"

If you'd prefer to have students work with github issues instead of pivotal tracker, I hacked up a script that will autopopulate all of your students' forks of the repo with the issues:

## Intro (a la Emily Platzer)

1. This assessment is fucking authentic. This is an example of what you will be doing IRL, getting paid, dolla dolla bills yaall. Jeff has been to site visits where previous students have been placed, and this is exactly what people are doing after graduation. Relational data in node, promises, templating, multiple tables... this assessment is fucking real. We are intentionally doing things that haven't been super rehearsed. We know that you can look it up.

2. We are giving you Thursday and Friday to work on this assessment. We will be around to clarify things, help when needed, but we want you to struggle a bit more than normal exercises. We will likely ask you questions to help you arrive to the answer. We will be using this as an opportunity to do some mastery tracking, so if you really need help, ask for it, and we will mark that as an area you may need help on. PRS by midnight Friday.
