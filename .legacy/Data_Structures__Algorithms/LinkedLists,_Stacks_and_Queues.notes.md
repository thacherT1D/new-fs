**Hook**

Give a really good hook.  If you are excited about them, students will be excited about them. While we don't _use_ LinkedLists in most modern web development, we study them because:

- They form the basis needed to grok Graphs and Trees, and there are _tons_ of Graphs and Trees (file systems, DOM, git)
- They force you to undertand references deeply - in a way you might not have been exposed to previously
- They force you to think about algorithms differently - for example _needing_ to traverse a data structure with a `while` loop
- Least of all, they may come up in interview questions
    
**I do**

- Lecture about LinkedLists.
- Draw the box/line diagram on the board
- Live code some basic LinkedList implementations
- Intro students to the test suite under exercises in the CS curriculum
