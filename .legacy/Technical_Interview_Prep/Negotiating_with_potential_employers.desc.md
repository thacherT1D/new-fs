So you've gotten an offer.  Now what?  The goal is to find a place where you will be _happy_, and to strike the right balance of being humble but not being taken advantage of.

One frequent criticism of code school graduates (from all schools) is that they have a sense of entitlement.  Here's a quick guide to help you advocate for yourself without coming across as seeming self-centered.

## When Applying

**Do**

Apply to stretch jobs.  Maybe you're better than you think!  Worst case scenario it's a good experience in interviewing, and most places can weed candidates out early on who are too weak.

**Don't**

Apply to any job you wouldn't seriously consider taking.  It's OK to want to work at lots of different kinds of companies, but if you know you'd turn down an offer even if it was strong, just don't apply in the first place.

## During the interview

We tell you that you are interviewing the company as much as they are interviewing you.  While this is true, it doesn't mean that you are _actually_ interviewing the company (aka asking how they measure up to the things you'd like the most).  Here are some good ways to "interview" without seeming like you have an agenda:

| What you say                                                                                                                  | What they hear                                                                                                  | How to fix it                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I really want a place that has strong pair programming and TDD.  How much do you pair?  Do you have a strong testing culture? | After 6 months I've _already_ formed strong opinions and if you don't meet my standards then I'm out.           | I'm super interested in how teams work.  What does your development process look like?  Do follow a particular kind of process (like XP agile, or GitHub pull requests)? |
| I want a place where there's strong mentorship where I can keep growing.  Do you have strong mentorship?                      | Even though you are paying me, I _also_ want you to keep teaching me, and if I don't get it, I'll keep looking. | What does your team structure look like as far as junior and senior developers?                                                                                          |

## After the offer

In some cases you may be juggling multiple offers.  Hiring managers will frequently ask you if you are looking elsewhere, and it's normal to say yes.  However, being _too_ transparent about what's happening can make you seem greedy.

**Do**

Say "Thank you for the offer! I need just a few days to think it over."

**Don't**

Say things like "I'm waiting to hear back from Company Y to see what they're offering, and then I'll get back to you."
