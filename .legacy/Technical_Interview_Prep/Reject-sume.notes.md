## Prep

* Create a google drive folder within student folder or in career services folder for resumes. ALL STUDENTS upload their PDF to this folder. Write access to the folder for students is fine.
* Create a list of students and break them into groups in a spreadsheet. Groups should be of equal size, odd numbers ok. Copy all students from second group down and paste at top, then copy first group and paste at bottom.
* Copy the form (linked in Description... and update that link) and edit students (copy and paste the group student cells into the "input" area of the question)
* Click on the form Add-ons (currently a puzzle piece icon). Click Form Publisher and Destination Folder and Naming Convention and change your destination directory your own path.
* When the exercise is over, share student's docs in that folder with that individual student.

## Creating list of students:

ex:

Group   | Evaluate
--------|--------
Matthew | Akyuna
Emily   | Dize
Luke    | Jeff
---|---
Akyuna  | Phil
Dize    | Lincoln
Jeff    | Edward
---|---
Phil    | Matthew
Lincoln | Emily
Edward  | Luke

Give students access to the spreadsheet to get order of resumes to review.

ex: Akyuna's group evaluate resumes in this order:

  *Phil, Lincoln, Edward, Matthew, Emily, Luke, Akyuna, Dize, Jeff.*
