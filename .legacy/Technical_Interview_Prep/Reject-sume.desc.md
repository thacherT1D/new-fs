Resumes get very little time with a hiring manager before they are rejected. Hiring managers often have piles of resumes to wade through, and the first or first several look-throughs are only meant to cull the pile into something more managable. If your resume is not up to par, you will not get even get consideration, much less any interviews! Spending some time looking at your classmates' resumes can help you get perspective on how a hiring manager quickly evaluates your resume.

# Objectives

1. Be able to see your resume through a hiring manager's eyes
1. Receive and process feedback on your resume
1. Improve your resume to be able to pass the first rounds of evaluation


## Exercise:

  * You will be in a group and receive a list of students.
  * You must get through AT LEAST the same number of resumes as group members, and then continue down the list.
  * Timebox 30 seconds to look at the resume. Then, without referencing the resume, answer the first portion of the response form.
    * This is not a speed reading competition. You are just trying to get a feel of that resume.
  * Take 5 minutes max (with a note-taker computer and resume-open computer) to answer the second portion of the response form.

### Timed round - 30 seconds

* Tech ability - are they jr? mid? sr?
* What is/are their language(s)?
  * If their past life shines too brightly, feel free to say "None - they are a lawyer/teacher/salesperson/what-have-you".
* Are they sloppy or precise? Arrogant? Humble? Competent?
* Front end? Back end? Full stack? Other?
* Other observations _______________________

### Deeper Check:

1. Actionable, Specific, and Kind!
1. Check for inconsistencies across the resume
  * node.js nodeJS NodeJS Node.JS
1. Check for correctness
  * ^^^ Of the above, which one is correct?
1. Colors - need to be consistent somehow
  * previous jobs are in blue, black, & red = bad
1. DRY but not "brittle"
  * repetition of words (not ideas) ok
    * if skills include angular and project includes angular, "AngularJS" may be listed several times
1. Links to all the places
  * Linked in
  * GitHub
  * Personal Portfolio site (if applicable. If not, GO MAKE ONE.)
  * all showcase project sites
1. Contact info!
  * If this is public (like on your website), consider removing personal contact deets.
  * Have a professional email (maybe not party4eva@example.com)
