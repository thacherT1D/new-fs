## Review Qs

What is REST, in your own words?

Can you update a resource with a GET request?

What are the seven restful routes of CRUD?

Write a sample url to show an individual resource.

In Express:

how do you access '/:id'?

how do you access the body of request?

how do you access the breed in '/puppies?color=red&breed=lab'?

In the Browser:

How do you create an DELETE Request?

How do you redirect the page for the user?

Best Practice:


Which is a valid query?

/app?type=puppy&id=32

/app?type="puppy"&id=32

/puppy?color=brown&breed=terrier

/puppy?color="brown"&breed="terrier"

Also,

'/house/23/puppy/1'

'/house/edit/23/puppy/1'

'/house/23/puppy/edit/1'
