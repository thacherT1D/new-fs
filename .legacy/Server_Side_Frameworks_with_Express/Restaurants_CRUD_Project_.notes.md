### g18 
This restaurants project is what we used in order to 'assess' the students understanding of the material learned each week in Q2 

How it worked: We would lecture and go through the learning experiences Monday - Thursday on the various topics of Q2, they were to complete the exercises associated with each day/learning experience. On Fridays however, there would be no new information! 

Fridays were project work days, assessment days, and break out sessions. 

#### Projects
We gave them the weekOne markdown of restaurants after week one and they had all day friday and the weekend to build that, the deployed version is what we would go through first thing monday morning with one on ones! This way we didn't have to go through all the small exercises they did building up that, and could have them implement the skills they learned throughout the week to an actual large project they would have and could potentially put on a resume! This also allowed us to do a quick walk through with them, see their code and understand where each student was at before kicking off the week! Students were then able to go back and make changes, stabilize the code, and implement feedback throughout the week before the next friday project requirements were released to them! 

#### Break Outs 
While about half the students spent most of friday working on the restaurants project, there were about half that needed that review or materials before tackling that. Therefore we had break out sessions through out the day where each instructor had a topic they were going to review, students had the option to go to these, go to multiple, go to one for half the time then bounce to another, etc etc. These worked great because it provided the support that some of the students needed and also the freedom that others needed. 

#### Assessments 
The smaller assessments were given end of day, other wise big assessments like full Stack CRUD assessments and automated testing CRUD were given first thing friday morning 

#### Lessons Learned 
We added to this restaurants project for the full four weeks (releasing each weeks requirements end of day thursday) of Q2, the students really enjoyed it, we liked it because we could see whether they could translate what they had learned over to an actual application AND because students didn't know what they were adding, many had to burn down or spend a whole day just organizing and refactoring code .... this truly drilled in the concept of reading through an entire project and all user stories before getting started which a lot of our students were not before!! We were also able to get a lot of data on where student were at!
