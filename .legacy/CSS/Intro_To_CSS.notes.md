##Livecode
Review HTML and set up a page, then add some CSS "on top".

- Use Sublime Text 3
   -  Create an HTML page with:
      - The doctype
      - An html tag, a head tag, a body tag
      - An h1
      - a paragraph
      -	a ul tag with some li tags
      - add links to the li tags
      - 3 image tags, with paragraphs under them
   - Add CSS
   		- Add css for the header, change the color to light grey and change the font to arial
   		- set color: DimGrey for the body tag & explain why it doesn't color the the h1
   		- Give the whole page a background image from subtlepatterns
   		- add a div around the content
   		- add a margin on the content div(with a class) of 20 px (play with it if it looks better on the screen at a different size)
   		- Give the div a colored background with transparency
   	- Position elements
   		- Wrap each image with a div
   		- Give it a class that describes what the element does
   		- float it left, see what happens
   	- Show what happens to these things in Chrome Dev Tools
   	- Explain the box model
   	- Explain floats
   	
   	
**(We Do)**  
They open the Learning Experience and follow a walkthrough that takes them through the box model and floats, then drops them off on their own to achieve goals that have been covered.

**(They Do)**  
Read the Mozilla Developer Network Getting Started Guide to CSS, work on  several exercises. Should take them the full day to get through them all.

### Checks for Understanding

* What is a CSS Selector?
* How do we line up elements horizontally?
* What property refers to the spacing on the outside of the element?
* How could we find out the hex code for a color we want?
* How would we stack `li` tags horizontally instead of vertically?
