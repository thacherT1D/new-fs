[Agile Project Management slides and expectations ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NpKJ2XxkAimuaihdoR8278YrpEyZpGz7qdHt9depVx0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Objectives

* Distinguish agile from traditional project management
* Describe the scrum process
* Define the roles of product owner, Scrum Master, developer
* Define story, epic, velocity, backlog, and sprint
* Write a user story
* Size a user story
* Setup a project in Pivotal Tracker

## Hook

* Traditional project management looks like this:
    * Planned up front
    * All features are developed from the start
    * Tested at the end
    * Shipped to the customer
* What happens when...
    * You only get 80% of that done?
    * Something changes?
* What if you did this:
    * Planned the features that you were working on now
    * Built and tested them
    * Shipped them to the customer frequently
* What happens when...
    * You only get 80% of that done?
    * Something changes?

## Agile Theory

### The Agile Manifesto

```
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
```


## Exercise: Waterfall & Agile

Describe a waterfall project that you worked on. What would have been different if it were run as an agile project? (10 Minutes)

Notes:

* If you weren't aware of the planning process being used, it was probably waterfall and you were probably only executing one level of the waterfall
* Did you have to follow a lot of broken processes?
* Did you feel any incentive to fix them?
* Did you feel any ownership of the work?
* Did you communicate with people before or after you in the process?

### User Story Formats

* (role) can (action)
* As a (role) I want (something) so that (benefit)

### Story Sizing

* Fibonacci
* Small, Medium, Large
* Small, needs to be split

## Exercise: Stories

* In groups, write stories for a forum, email client, or search engine (15 minutes)
    * Look for good story format
    * User's language- nothing technical
* Prioritize these features
    * One person acts as product owner
    * Asks for the teams' feedback on prioritizing, but makes the decisions
    * _Why_ is something higher priority?
* As the dev team, size them using planning poker (15 minutes)
    * One person acts as Scrum Master, doesn't vote
    * Prioritize from top to bottom
    * Low / High numbers have to defend
    * Drive consensus

## Agile Project Management Software

* [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com)

## Exercise: Pivotal Tracker

* Take the stories from your group and enter them into a project on your Pivotal Tracker account (30 minutes, on own)
    * Instructors can make Tracker accounts for the whole class in the cohort view of the LMS with `Setup` -> `Tracker Accounts`
    * Students access their tracker accounts by resetting their passwords
