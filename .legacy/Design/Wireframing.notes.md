## Objectives

* Differentiate wireframes from mockups
* Build an information architecture from a content inventory
* Draw thumbnail sketches
* Draw a wireframe diagram
* Use a grid
* Articulate web design principles
* Write markup for a wireframe
* Use digital tools for generating wireframes

## Hook

* Some sites are really intense looking
* Once you take the skin off, the skeletons are usually very simple

## What is a wireframe?

* Wireframes describe layout
* Not content, not polish, not color
* Not mockups
* One of the tools for capturing requirements

## Information Architecture

### Content Inventories

* Make a list of all of the things your site your site should have
    * Images
    * Text
    * Navigation

### Information Hierarchy

* Understand the relationship between the things in your content inventory
* What's important
* What goes together
* "Information Architecture"

## Thumbnail Sketches

* Fast! 10 seconds or less
* Macro-layout
* Don't stay married to a design

## Building a Wireframe

* Placeholders
* Relationships
* Micro-interactions

## Grids

* 12-column grids
* Gutters
* Ratios
* Draw on top of the grid

## Design for the web

* Design for flow
* Ignore the vertical
* Consider breakpoints
* "Mobile First"
* Design library

## Markup

* What are all of the elements, semantically?
* What containers do they have?
* Box model
