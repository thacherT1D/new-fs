## Rationale

With pairing, it's easy for one student to mask the weaknesses
of the other. The structure of Sage and Scribe prevents this from happening.
The students take turns driving and asking questions.

**"The very act of creating questions, for yourself, is a profound step toward understanding."** - from _5 Elements of Effective Thinking_  
Scribes get practice forming good, precise questions.

## How it works
Students work in pairs.

Partner 1 is the **sage**.
Partner 2 is the **scribe**.

The **sage** says _what_ to do.

The **scribe** does exactly what the sage says.
The scribe can ask questions of the sage, but only for the purpose of
guidance/clarification. The scribe may never tell the sage what to do _or_ do
something they weren't instructed to do.

After a pre-determined amount of time, the sage and scribe switch roles.

Example questions that the scribe might ask:
* How could we figure out what that method does?
* What did we do before when we faced a similar problem?
* Do we know of a method that might do x or y for us?
* Could you be more specific?
* What file is that in?
* How else might we go about solving this?

## Notes
* Students will become frustrated. Tell them that this is a good thing!
