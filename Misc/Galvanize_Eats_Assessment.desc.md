## Background

**Galvanize Eats** is a food service that delivers burgers and pizza on demand. You are building their new site, which includes a light ordering web app. The landing page of the site should tell you some basic information about the company, while the web app should show you a sorted list of menu items, allow you to build an order, enter in your delivery information, and submit the order to Galvanize Eats. Your product owner has created a list of prioritized user stories for you to work down.

## Use the Galvanize Eats repo as a base

Fork/clone [this repo](https://github.com/gSchool/galvanize-eats). You are required to use this repo and keep this folder structure.

## Enable issues on your fork of the repository

We will walk you through this, and once everyone has forked the repo and enabled issues, we will create the issues for your repo. This will give you a nice, ordered list of all the things that need to be built for this project.

## APIs

The project involves two API calls. The first, to get the menu data should be a GET request to this url: [https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/menu](https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/menu). The second request, to post an order, should be a POST request to this url: [https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/orders](https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/orders). 

Your post request should submit the user order. When you have successfully hit the POST api you will see "Congratulations!".

## Notes
