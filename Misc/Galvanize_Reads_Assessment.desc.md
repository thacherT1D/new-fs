## Background

**Galvanize Reads** is a book catalog service that stores a list of recommended technology books. You are building a web app for them. It should allow you to:

* List books and authors
* Add books and authors
* Modify books and authors
* Remove books and authors

There are some additional features, such as search, that are nice-to-haves, but a lower priority than the core features. The folks at Galvanize Reads have provided you some sample data from their existing registry that you can use for development.

## How to Submit Your Assessment

Fork/clone [this repo](https://github.com/gSchool/galvanize-reads).
Add a README to your project that has:

* A link to your deployed site
* Link to your tracker project
* An ERD of the final data model of the project (see [draw.io](http://www.draw.io) or [gliffy.com](http://www.gliffy.com) for some diagramming tools)

Submit a pull request to the orginal repo with this README.

## Notes

* You can use a styling library if you'd like
* You can use server-side templating or AJAX/RESTful services. There are trade-offs with each, but server-side templating will likely be faster to build.
* You can use a raw database driver, a query builder, or an ORM for your database connection. A query builder, such as Knex, is recommended.
* Use feature-branch workflows. You should end up with one commit for each feature.
* Deploy your work often (ideally after completion of every new feature).
* Be aware of your time and don't spend too long working on a given item before moving on / asking for help. For example, you shouldn't spend longer than a couple of hours (max!) working on migrations / seeding. If you find yourself stick working on the db setup in the afternoon of day 1, ask an instructor for assistance.
* In the submission repo, there are tests written out so that you can follow a TDD workflow. Feel free to use them or to delete/disregard them - whichever is more helpful.
* One wireframe shows a horizontal menu instead of the vertical one on the rest of the wireframes. Feel free to do either style (the horizontal one is easier).

## Import stories into Pivotal Tracker

Import the following CSV into a new project in Pivotal Tracker to get the requirements for this story (Settings -> Import CSV). They are prioritized. You may find it useful to size the stories before you begin. Start your project name with "g27_" so that we can easily clean up Pivotal Tracker later.
