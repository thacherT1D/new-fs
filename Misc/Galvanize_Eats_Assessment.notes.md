* This is intended to be a Q1 assessment, and a companion to the personal front-end project. It accurately represents authentic junior developer tasks. It uses:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * DOM Manipulation
    * Arrays & Objects
    * Sorting
    * Calculations
    * GET and POST API calls
    * Forms
    * Events
    * Validation
    * Agile
    * Git
    * Deployment
* You have to add your cohort group to the assessment repo before they can see it
* A potential solution is in this [private repo](https://github.com/gSchool/galvanize-eats-solution.git)
* Original intention is to limit them to a day. Need to test out how long it actually takes
* Also my intention to replace the screenshots with wireframes, just need to make them
* Might be cool to have the POST endpoint return something
* API is hosted on Heroku under "galvanize-eats-api"
