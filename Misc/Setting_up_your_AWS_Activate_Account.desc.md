## Overview

As part of Galvanize, you are entitled to $5,000 in AWS credits!!

Here's how to get started:

## Step 1

Create an Amazon account using the email you use to log into this LMS.  This will match your GitHub email.

When you sign up, you will need to enter a credit card.

You will automatically have a free tier for 1 year.  If you incur any overages, it's likely that when you apply your credits, they will apply retroactively.  

> That said, try not to spend too much before the credits come through - we make no guarantees that the program will still be valid for you (because we depend on Amazon to provide this service).

## Step 2

If you somehow came across this _not_ from a link from your instructor, make sure your name has been added to our list and submitted to Amazon.

## Step 3

Go to http://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolioplus-signup/

Fill in the form on the right-hand side of the page.

```

## Step 4

Wait.

It usually takes 2-3 weeks for the credits to appear.  Again, you should be on the free tier until then, and charges you accrue will likely be erased once the credit is applied.
