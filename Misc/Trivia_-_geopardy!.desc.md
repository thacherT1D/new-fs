__The style of trivia implemented here is designed to help students practice evaluating code without using an IDE or running the code itself in a browser or REPL__

The students are split up into randomly generated teams of 3 (on average). The game lasts about 45 - 60 min.

### Popular Question Categories:

- What does the following function output when invoked? ( 3 min)
- What is logged to the console? ( 3 min)
- What is logged to the console and in what order? (3 min)
- Write a function that ... (5 - 10 min depending on difficulty, this type of question does not require an explanation. Code works or it doesn't)

### Answering Questions - 2 Parts:

Teams must answer the question as well as provide an explanation for how they arrived at their answer. Correct answers with incorrect explanations are not awarded points.

### Awarding Points

Teams are put in a queue in the order the teams submit answers. If a team edits their answer during the allotted time, the answer is valid, but the team loses their place in the queue. The queue order is determined by answer submission, NOT explanation submission. The two are submitted separately.

The first team to submit a correct answer is awarded 2 points. All other correct answers are awarded 1 point. Again, a team is only awarded points if the explanation is also correct.
