### NOTE: Trivia does not work well with ALL cohorts. For some, it will bring out the worst and you may want to steer clear :D
Trivia is also much more fun and beneficial when we get more into js functions and the server-side! 

Some have a theme (example: understanding scope ...) and others are based on mastery tracker. Some are just fun! [Question Sets](https://github.com/gSchool/trivia-question-sets)

Remember Doogie Howser? Well, it turns out the theme song provides excellent trivia background music :D The theme song is 1:05 minutes and can be looped to represent each minute that is allowed for answering the question. [Doogie Howser Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrERtikdPus)
You can use this video looper to keep the music running as long as you need [YouTube Video Looper](http://www.infinitelooper.com/)

The music is played while students are working on a trivia question. As the game progresses and the students' competitive natures unfold, I recommend something edgier (Metallica's Enter Sandman has been working really well. LOL)

Students will get very competitive and will challenge many of the answers and explanations and make arguments for why their answer is correct, or another team's is incorrect. Stick to your guns and be the authority!

One of our students built an app that we use to facilitate trivia. It is a WIP but works very well for a couple of things:

1. Tracks the order in which teams submit answers
1. Explanation submissions
1. Keeping score
1. Setting a timer that all teams can view
1. When time is up, the app does not allow answers or explanations to be submitted

### NOTES: 

It an be handy to assign one instructor to be the "judge" and another to be the "host". Students get seriously competitive and this helps keep things productive and keeps "host' abuse to a minimum. 

For "Write a function that ..." questions, have a test file open and ready to paste student solutions into and run them in a REPL to determine working code from broken code. Run it so that students can see the output. 

### PRIZES:

It's extra awesome if you have something to award to the winning team. For us, we had a stash of random swag that wasn't given out to the students so it was especially sought after. We've also learned that students love dev stickers! So we ordered a bunch of those too to give out!

### LONG ROAD:

The longterm vision here is for different campuses to be able to compete against each other for trivia. All participating cohorts will login to the app and choose a game to join. The game can be facilitated using skype or google hangouts and the app will keep track of submissions etc. This functionality does not yet exist.
