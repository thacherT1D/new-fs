- Metacognitive strategies refers to methods used to help students understand the way they learn; in other words, it means processes designed for students to 'think' about their 'thinking'. As students become aware of how they learn, they will use these processes to efficiently acquire new information, and consequently, become more of an independent thinker.
In a blog post,
 - describe a time when new information seemed to click, be as specific as you can. Include examples of code if possible. What factors do you think contributed to your understanding (eg. good nights rest, instructional style, time of day, etc. ).
 - describe a time when you where frustrated by new content. Use the same guidelines as above to flesh out your description.
 - Using metacognition, what are some steps that you can take to take to maximize your wins, and quickly recover from frustration?
 - You do not need to post this anywhere public if you do not feel comfortable doing so. The purpose of this exercise to for you to think about the way you learn, and create a resource you can use to be reminded of your successes, and tools you can use to efficiently recover from frustrating situations.
- Turn and talk: What do you think is meant by a "Culture of Error."
