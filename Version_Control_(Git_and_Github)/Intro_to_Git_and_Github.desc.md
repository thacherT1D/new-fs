# Track Changes with Git

## Objectives

* Discuss what a Version Control System is
* Describe the purpose of a staging area/index
* Describe the relationship between a repository and a working
  directory
* Initialize a git repository with `git init`
* Check the status of changed files in a git repository with `git status`
* Stage new and changed files with `git add`
* Commit staged files to the git repository with `git commit`

## Version Control System

Version control is a class of tools that programmers use to manage software projects.
It allows you to track changes you make to files on your machine.
This is helpful for when you screw things up! And you will. ðŸ˜‰
And that's ok. Version control allows developers to revert back to a specific time and place in your code. Sort of like a reset button.

Version control allows developers to:

  * Keep track of changes to files over time
  * View previous states of your project
  * Return to a previous state of your project
  * Manage changes to files from multiple people
  * Make changes without worrying about stability
  * Keep files together as a group

There are many flavors of VCS:

  * Git
  * Mercurial
  * SVN
  * Perforce
  * TFS
  * etc.

## What is Git?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source software for version control.
While there are many different version control systems, git is incredibly popular and powerful. Many companies use git, and if you understand git it will be easy to learn another version control paradigm.

Any files tracked by git typically go through 3 stages:

1. Unstaged
  * These changes will not be committed in the next commit
1. Staged
  * These changes will be committed in the next commit
1. Committed
  * Changes committed in the last commit

## What is GitHub?

*Git* and *GitHub* are **NOT** the same thing.
[Github](http://github.com/) is a web based service that hosts repositories on a server and allows developers to easily collaborate.
Github acts as a remote backup service for git repositories.
Once we've __pushed__ to a __remote__ such as GitHub, we know our code is safe.
Even if our hard drives die.
And if GitHub goes down, we can still work on our distributed repos offline.

## A Metaphor: Git is a Rocketship, Github is Mars ðŸš€

| Rocketship Version | Git Version |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Package | Unstaged change |
| Package on Launchpad | Staged change |
| Package in Rocketship | Commited change |
| Launch | Push |
| Launchpad | Staging area |
| Rocketship | Git repo |
| Mars | GitHub |
| Mars Landing Pad Coordinates | Remote |

Let's say you want to deliver some packages to Mars with a rocketship. *You want to push changes to GitHub from your git repo*

1. Create some packages.
 * *Make some changes to your files*

1. Choose which packages to place on the launchpad.
  * *`git add` the changed files you want to push*

1. Put the packages on the launchpad into the rocketship.
  * *`git commit`*

  * Any packages left off the launchpad and not in the rocketship will not be sent to Mars.
    * *Any changes not staged with `git add` will not be committed and will not be pushed to GitHub*

1. Repeat the create packages, move to launchpad, and pack rocketship steps for any additional packages you want to send.
  * *Change files, `git add`, `git commit`*

1. Set the rocketship coordinates for Mars.
  * *`git remote add origin git@github.com:nasa/marooned-astronaut.git`*
  * We'll reuse our rocketship, so you only need to do this once per rocket!

1. When the rocketship is sufficiently loaded, we want to launch the rocketship to Mars.
  * *`git push -u origin master`*

1. Astronaut on Mars will recieve your rocketship and be happy with their new packages.
  * *Check your GitHub repo to make sure the changes were pushed*

## Basic Git Commands

There are 5 main commands for `git`

 * init
 * status
 * add
 * commit
 * push

With these 5 commands you can create a repo and start versioning your project.


### init
Initialize a new git repo in the current directory with:

```
$ git init
```

Boom! Your directory is now a git repository! ðŸ’¥

You can verify this by checking that a `.git` subdirectory was created when you run `ls -a`.

The .git subdirectory contains a number of subdirectories and files that keep track of all the changes happening in your working tree, or repo as we are now calling it. You will also find configuration details, a list of branches, Github remotes and also things called SHAs. SHAs are a long series of numbers used as a unique ID for your commits. Don't worry too much about that right now, just know that the *.git* subdirectory is where all that stuff related to your git repo is stored.

> Docs: [git manual](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init) or `man git-init`


### add
Lets say you modified a file in your repo, you can tell git to start tracking it  with:

```
$ git add <the_name_of_the_file>
```

This then adds that file to the *staging area*, or *index* as it's sometimes referred to.

If you've made changes to several files, and even created a few new ones
as well, you can tell git to track all things that have been changed or
newly created inside the working directory with:

```
$ git add .
```

Remember the `.` just means *everything inside the directory I'm
currently standing in*

It is good practice to make a few changes that all relate to a single
task and *add* them to the staging area individually using that first
command. You would then *commit* that group of files at one time. More
on that part in a bit.

On occation you will do things that create a crazy number of files all
at once, in which case using `git add .` makes more sense.

> Docs: [git manual](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) or `man git-add`


### status
If you type `git status` when in a git repository it will show you if you
have any staged or unstaged files. Remember from the metaphor above
*unstaged* changes are those packages on the launch pad waiting to be
loaded up into the rocket and *staged* changes are the packages already
loaded on the rocket ready to be committed to mars.

in your git repository (working directory):

```
$ git status
```

example output:

```
$ git status
on branch g15

initial commit

changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   readme.md

untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	01_file_one.md
	02_file_two.md
	03_some_other_file.md
```

> docs: [git manual](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) or `man git-status`

### commit
After staging files with `git add` you will then be able to commit those changes. This will save the current state of the project as a snapshot in time.

```
$ git commit -m "I fixed all of the bugs. ðŸ˜ƒ"
```

This will create a commit in git that will be a snapshot of the current
state of your working directory. And yes, you can even use emojis in your commit
messages! ðŸŽ‰

If you make a few changes and apply the `git add` command you previously
learned on just some of those files, and then use the `git status`
command you will see some of the files are green and some are red. The
green ones are all the files that you have *add*ed to the *index*, or
have "staged". The red ones are the *unstaged* files. When you run `git commit`
only the green, or "staged" files will be committed, AKA, saved to git. The red ones will
just remain in the "staging area" waiting to be added for the next
commit trip to Mars.

> Docs: [git manual](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) or `man git-commit`


### push
If you are using GitHub or collaborating with another git repo, you can push any new commits to your default remote with:

```
$ git push
```

Using the `push` command will update your default *remote* repository.
For you this will typically be some Github repo you have created and will be the backed-up-on-the-web source of truth for your project.

If you have your remote pointing to GitHub, you should be able to see the changes you *push* on your GitHub page.

#### remotes
You can have mulitple *remotes* and give them different nicknames but there
is only one default remote. By convention the default remote is named "origin". You can
check your *remotes* by running `git remote -v`. Don't worry too much
more about remotes for now, just know generally what they represent and
how to look at them.
