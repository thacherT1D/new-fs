# OOP I Did It Again: Prototypal Inheritance and JS

## Objectives

- Implement Prototypal Inheritance in Javascript.

## Intro

Javascript makes use of `Prototypal Inheritance`, while most other languages utilize `Classical Inheritance`.

Example:

prototype
hasOwnProperty
this
call / apply / bind
prototype chain

function Child(){
  Parent.call(this);
}
Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype)

**I Do**

I demonstrate how to implement prototypal inheritance using an example.

**We Do**

Together we think of a similar model where inheritance would be useful.

**You Do**

You are provided with a model and need to implement it.
