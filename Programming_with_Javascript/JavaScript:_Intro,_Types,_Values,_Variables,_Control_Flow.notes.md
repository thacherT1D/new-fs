### 4: How to Use a REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop)
Instructor: Take a few minutes to describe the user interface of [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript)

### 5: Create Primitive Types
Mini-whiteboards: What's the data type of this value: `5` [[Answer: `Number`.]]

Mini-whiteboards: What's the data type of this value: `"5"` [[Answer: `String`.]]

Mini-whiteboards: What's the data type of: `true` [[Answer: `boolean`]]

Mini-whiteboards: What's the data type of: `3.14` [[Answer: `number`]]

###  6: The `typeof` operator
Research: What's the data type that the `typeof` operator returns. [[Answer: `String`]]

### 7: Use `console.log([value])`
Mini-whitebards: If I want to log the resolved value of `5 + 5` in my console, what would I have to write inside of `console.log()`. [[Answer: `console.log(5 + 5)`]]

### 8: Create expressions with operators
Mini-whitebards: What's the expression: `5 + 5`. And then circle the values. [[Answer: `5`, `5`, resolved value of `5 + 5`]]

### Order of operations
Per table: have students come up with mathematical expression parentheses included(4 - 6 terms). Write them up so everyone can see. Have them give you an answer, and have them double check it on REPL.

### Modulus operator
Per table: have them come up with a test plan to see where does modules fall in the order of operation.
Write expression and expected result where everyone can see. Have them each test each expression.

### String methods
Per student: search for string methods. have the students pick one and implement it. Should present to each other at their table.

### 9: Comparison operators
Mini-whitebards: What's the Boolean value of this expression: `5 != "5"`. [[Answer: `false`]]

### 10: Logical Operators
Mini-whitebards: what's the return value of this expression: `5 && "100"`. [[Answer: `"100"`]]

Mini-whitebards: what's the return value of this expression: `false || "100"`. [[Answer: `"100"`]]

### 11: Variables
Mini-whitebards: Write the syntax for a variable statement. [[Answer: `var name = "value";`]]

### 12: Primitive Types are Immutable
Fist to five: Does variable assignment with primitive types make sense? Can someone explain it?
