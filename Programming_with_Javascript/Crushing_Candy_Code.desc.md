## Crushing Candy Code

Repo: [Crushing Candy Code](https://github.com/gSchool/ccf-data-structures)

This is an exercise to help you get familiar selecting values from nested data structures.

Be sure to review dot notation vs. bracket notation and when you need to use one over the other.

You will be using array and object methods, if you're not comfortable with these, review them first.


Once you get to the looping section, it makes more sense for us to create functions for each exercise. Instead of commenting out previous code as you go on, we can define a function and then just comment out the function invocation to keep things cleaner.

Loop through a specific date in store 1 and find total candies sold.
```js
function candiesSoldByDate(date){
// your code here
}
candiesSoldByDate('2015-01-06');
```
